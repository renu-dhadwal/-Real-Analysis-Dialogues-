**Acharya Bhaskara**:  
“Lila, now that we understand completeness, let us move to another fundamental idea in real analysis — *intervals*.”

## 🔹 What Are Intervals?

**Acharya Bhaskara**:  
“An **interval** is simply a stretch of the real line without gaps. Formally:  

- A set of the form $[a,b] = \{x \in \mathbb{R} : a \le x \le b\}$ is a **closed interval**.  
- $(a,b) = \{x \in \mathbb{R} : a < x < b\}$ is an **open interval**.  
- Similarly, we have half-open intervals $(a,b], [a,b)$.  
- And we allow intervals to extend infinitely: $(-\infty,a), [a,\infty), (-\infty,\infty) = \mathbb{R}$.  

All of these are examples of intervals.”

**Lila**:  
“So intervals are just stretches of the real line. Isn’t that obvious?”  

**Acharya Bhaskara**:  
“It looks obvious, yes, but let us be precise. What makes these sets *intervals* and not just any arbitrary subset of $\mathbb{R}$? The essence is that they have **no gaps**. This brings us to an important theorem.”

### 🔹 Characterization Theorem

::: theorem
**Characterization Theorem of Intervals.**  
A nonempty subset $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is an **interval** if and only if it has the following property:  

- Whenever $x,y \in S$ with $x < y$, then every real number $z$ with $x < z < y$ also belongs to $S$.  

Equivalently, if $x,y \in S$ and $x < y$, then the entire closed segment $[x,y]$ is contained in $S$.  
:::

#### 🔹 Examples

::: example
**Example 1.**  
Take $S = (0,1)$. If $x,y \in S$ and $x < y$, then any $z$ with $x < z < y$ also satisfies $0 < z < 1$, so $z \in S$.  
Thus $(0,1)$ is an interval.
:::

::: example
**Example 2.**  
Take $S = (0,1) \cup (2,3)$. Here $0.5 \in S$ and $2.5 \in S$, but the point $1.5$ between them is **not** in $S$.  
So $S$ fails the characterization property and is not an interval.
:::

**Lila**:  
“So the theorem says: intervals are exactly those sets that never leave out the points in between.”  

**Acharya Bhaskara**:  
“Exactly, Lila. And notice — this depends on working inside the real numbers. In the rationals, for example, the set  
$$
S = \{x \in \mathbb{Q} : x^2 < 2\}
$$  
fails the property, because the real point $\sqrt{2}$ between some rationals is missing.”

#### ✅ Try it yourself
::: exercise-box
**Exercise.** Decide whether the following sets are intervals:

1. $[0,1)\cup(1,2]$  
2. $(-\infty,0)\cup(0,\infty)$
3. $\mathbb{Z}$ (the set of all integers)

1. **$[0,1)\cup(1,2]$** → ❌ Not an interval. The point $1$ is missing, so the set has a gap.

2. **$(-\infty,0)\cup(0,\infty)$** → ❌ Not an interval. $0$ is missing.

3. **$\mathbb{Z}$** → ❌ Not an interval. There are infinitely many gaps (e.g., between $2$ and $3$ there is no integer).

### 🔹 The Nested Interval Property

**Acharya Bhaskara**:  
“Lila, now that you understand what intervals are, let me show you one of their most remarkable features — the *Nested Interval Property*. It is a direct consequence of completeness.”  

---

::: theorem
**Nested Interval Property.**  
Let $(I_n)$ be a sequence of closed intervals
$$
I_n = [a_n, b_n], \quad n=1,2,3,\ldots
$$
such that  

1. The intervals are nested:  
   $$
   I_1 \supseteq I_2 \supseteq I_3 \supseteq \cdots
   $$  

2. The lengths shrink to $0$:  
   $$
   \lim_{n \to \infty} (b_n - a_n) = 0.
   $$  

Then there exists a **unique point** $c \in \mathbb{R}$ such that
$$
\bigcap_{n=1}^\infty I_n = \{c\}.
$$
:::

---

### 🔹 Example

::: example
**Example.**  
Take
$$
I_n = \left[0, \tfrac{1}{n}\right].
$$
Clearly $I_1 \supseteq I_2 \supseteq I_3 \supseteq \cdots$, and the lengths $b_n - a_n = \tfrac{1}{n} \to 0$.  
Thus
$$
\bigcap_{n=1}^\infty I_n = \{0\}.
$$
:::

### ✅ Try it Yourself

::: exercise-box
**Exercise.**  
Consider the nested intervals
$$
I_n = \left[1, 1 + \tfrac{1}{n}\right].
$$

1. Are the intervals nested?  
2. What is $\bigcap_{n=1}^\infty I_n$?  

---

<summary><strong>Show Answers</strong></summary>
Yes, the intervals are nested since each $I_{n+1} \subseteq I_n$.  
The lengths $b_n - a_n = \tfrac{1}{n} \to 0$.  
Hence,
$$
\bigcap_{n=1}^\infty I_n = \{1\}.
$$
