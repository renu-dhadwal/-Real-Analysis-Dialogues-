# 🌉 Level 2: Intervals and Their Characterization

**Acharya Bhaskara**:  
“Lila, now that we understand completeness, let us move to another fundamental idea in real analysis — *intervals*.”

## 🔹 What Are Intervals?

**Acharya Bhaskara**:  
“An **interval** is simply a stretch of the real line without gaps. Formally:  

- A set of the form $[a,b] = \{x \in \mathbb{R} : a \le x \le b\}$ is a **closed interval**.  
- $(a,b) = \{x \in \mathbb{R} : a < x < b\}$ is an **open interval**.  
- Similarly, we have half-open intervals $(a,b], [a,b)$.  
- And we allow intervals to extend infinitely: $(-\infty,a), [a,\infty), (-\infty,\infty) = \mathbb{R}$.  

All of these are examples of intervals.”

**Lila**:  
“So intervals are just stretches of the real line. Isn’t that obvious?”  

**Acharya Bhaskara**:  
“It looks obvious, yes, but let us be precise. What makes these sets *intervals* and not just any arbitrary subset of $\mathbb{R}$? The essence is that they have **no gaps**. This brings us to an important theorem.”

## 🔹 Characterization Theorem

::: theorem
**Characterization Theorem of Intervals.**  
A nonempty subset $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is an **interval** if and only if it has the following property:  

- Whenever $x,y \in S$ with $x < y$, then every real number $z$ with $x < z < y$ also belongs to $S$.  

Equivalently, if $x,y \in S$ and $x < y$, then the entire closed segment $[x,y]$ is contained in $S$.

## 🔹 Examples

::: example
**Example 1.**  
Take $S = (0,1)$. If $x,y \in S$ and $x < y$, then any $z$ with $x < z < y$ also satisfies $0 < z < 1$, so $z \in S$.  
Thus $(0,1)$ is an interval.
:::

::: example
**Example 2.**  
Take $S = (0,1) \cup (2,3)$. Here $0.5 \in S$ and $2.5 \in S$, but the point $1.5$ between them is **not** in $S$.  
So $S$ fails the characterization property and is not an interval.
:::

**Lila**:  
“So the theorem says: intervals are exactly those sets that never leave out the points in between.”  

**Acharya Bhaskara**:  
“Exactly, Lila. And notice — this depends on working inside the real numbers. In the rationals, for example, the set  
$$
S = \{x \in \mathbb{Q} : x^2 < 2\}
$$  
fails the property, because the real point $\sqrt{2}$ between some rationals is missing.”

## ✅ Try it yourself

::: exercise-box
**Exercise.**  
Decide whether the following sets are intervals:  

1. $[0,1) \cup (1,2]$  
2. $(-\infty,0) \cup (0,\infty)$  
3. $\mathbb{Z}$ (the set of all integers)

## 💡 Answers

::: {.callout-collapse title="Show Answers"}
1. **$[0,1) \cup (1,2]$** → ❌ Not an interval. The point $1$ is missing, so the set has a gap.  

2. **$(-\infty,0) \cup (0,\infty)$** → ❌ Not an interval. $0$ is missing, so the property fails.  

3. **$\mathbb{Z}$** → ❌ Not an interval. There are infinitely many gaps (e.g., between $2$ and $3$ there is no integer).
