‚ÄúLila, now that we understand completeness, let us move to another fundamental idea in real analysis ‚Äî *intervals*.‚Äù

## üîπ What Are Intervals?

**Acharya Bhaskara**:  
‚ÄúAn **interval** is simply a stretch of the real line without gaps. Formally:  

- A set of the form $[a,b] = \{x \in \mathbb{R} : a \le x \le b\}$ is a **closed interval**.  
- $(a,b) = \{x \in \mathbb{R} : a < x < b\}$ is an **open interval**.  
- Similarly, we have half-open intervals $(a,b], [a,b)$.  
- And we allow intervals to extend infinitely: $(-\infty,a), [a,\infty), (-\infty,\infty) = \mathbb{R}$.  

All of these are examples of intervals.‚Äù

**Lila**:  
‚ÄúSo intervals are just stretches of the real line. Isn‚Äôt that obvious?‚Äù  

**Acharya Bhaskara**:  
‚ÄúIt looks obvious, yes, but let us be precise. What makes these sets *intervals* and not just any arbitrary subset of $\mathbb{R}$? The essence is that they have **no gaps**. This brings us to an important theorem.‚Äù

### üîπ Characterization Theorem

::: theorem
**Characterization Theorem of Intervals.**  
A nonempty subset $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is an **interval** if and only if it has the following property:  

- Whenever $x,y \in S$ with $x < y$, then every real number $z$ with $x < z < y$ also belongs to $S$.  

Equivalently, if $x,y \in S$ and $x < y$, then the entire closed segment $[x,y]$ is contained in $S$.  
:::

---

#### üîπ Examples

::: example
**Example 1.**  
Take $S = (0,1)$. If $x,y \in S$ and $x < y$, then any $z$ with $x < z < y$ also satisfies $0 < z < 1$, so $z \in S$.  
Thus $(0,1)$ is an interval.
:::

::: example
**Example 2.**  
Take $S = (0,1) \cup (2,3)$. Here $0.5 \in S$ and $2.5 \in S$, but the point $1.5$ between them is **not** in $S$.  
So $S$ fails the characterization property and is not an interval.
:::

**Lila**:  
‚ÄúSo the theorem says: intervals are exactly those sets that never leave out the points in between.‚Äù  


## üîπ A Subtle Example: Working in $\mathbb{Q}$

**Lila**:  
‚ÄúAcharya, what about the set  
$$
S = \{x \in \mathbb{Q} : x^2 < 2\}?
$$  
Is that an interval?‚Äù

**Acharya Bhaskara**:  
‚ÄúAn excellent question! Let us analyze carefully.‚Äù

::: rule-box
**Remark (Intervals in $\mathbb{Q}$ vs $\mathbb{R}$).**

- In $\mathbb{Q}$:  
  $$
  S = \{x \in \mathbb{Q} : x^2 < 2\}
  $$
  contains all rationals with $x^2 < 2$, e.g. $1.41 \in S$, but excludes any rational $y$ with $y^2 > 2$, such as $1.42$.  
  Crucially, it also excludes $\sqrt{2}$, because $\sqrt{2} \notin \mathbb{Q}$.  
  So $S$ ‚Äústops‚Äù at $\sqrt{2}$ but never includes it. This breaks the interval property inside $\mathbb{Q}$.

- In $\mathbb{R}$:  
  The same description becomes  
  $$
  \{x \in \mathbb{R} : x^2 < 2\} = (-\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{2}),
  $$  
  which **is** an interval, because the reals contain the missing boundary points.

üëâ This shows the difference between **density** (rationals are everywhere between rationals) and **completeness** (the reals include all limit points, like $\sqrt{2}$).

#### ‚úÖ Try it yourself
::: exercise-box
**Exercise.** Decide whether the following sets are intervals:

1. $[0,1)\cup(1,2]$  
2. $(-\infty,0)\cup(0,\infty)$
3. $\mathbb{Z}$ (the set of all integers)

1. **$[0,1)\cup(1,2]$** ‚Üí ‚ùå Not an interval. The point $1$ is missing, so the set has a gap.

2. **$(-\infty,0)\cup(0,\infty)$** ‚Üí ‚ùå Not an interval. $0$ is missing.

3. **$\mathbb{Z}$** ‚Üí ‚ùå Not an interval. There are infinitely many gaps (e.g., between $2$ and $3$ there is no integer).

### üîπ The Nested Interval Property

**Acharya Bhaskara**:  
‚ÄúLila, now that you understand what intervals are, let me show you one of their most remarkable features ‚Äî the *Nested Interval Property*. It is a direct consequence of completeness.‚Äù  

---

::: theorem
**Nested Interval Property.**  
Let $(I_n)$ be a sequence of closed intervals
$$
I_n = [a_n, b_n], \quad n=1,2,3,\ldots
$$
such that  

1. The intervals are nested:  
   $$
   I_1 \supseteq I_2 \supseteq I_3 \supseteq \cdots
   $$  

2. The lengths shrink to $0$:  
   $$
   \lim_{n \to \infty} (b_n - a_n) = 0.
   $$  

Then there exists a **unique point** $c \in \mathbb{R}$ such that
$$
\bigcap_{n=1}^\infty I_n = \{c\}.
$$
:::

---

### üîπ Example

::: example
**Example.**  
Take
$$
I_n = \left[0, \tfrac{1}{n}\right].
$$
Clearly $I_1 \supseteq I_2 \supseteq I_3 \supseteq \cdots$, and the lengths $b_n - a_n = \tfrac{1}{n} \to 0$.  
Thus
$$
\bigcap_{n=1}^\infty I_n = \{0\}.
$$
:::

### ‚úÖ Try it Yourself

::: exercise-box
**Exercise.**  
Consider the nested intervals
$$
I_n = \left[1, 1 + \tfrac{1}{n}\right].
$$

1. Are the intervals nested?  
2. What is $\bigcap_{n=1}^\infty I_n$?

Yes, the intervals are nested since each $I_{n+1} \subseteq I_n$.  
The lengths $b_n - a_n = \tfrac{1}{n} \to 0$.  
Hence,
$$
\bigcap_{n=1}^\infty I_n = \{1\}.
$$

# Uncountability of $\mathbb{R}$

**Lila:** Acharya, now that we know the Nested Interval Property, can we use it to prove that the real numbers are uncountable?

**Acharya Bhaskar:** Certainly, Lila. We'll give a clear proof by contradiction.

**Lila:** OK ‚Äî what do we assume for contradiction?

**Acharya Bhaskar:** Assume $\mathbb{R}$ is countable. Then every real number in the interval $[0,1]$ can be listed:
$$
x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots
$$
(If $\mathbb{R}$ were countable then any nonempty subinterval like $[0,1]$ would also be countable, so this is legitimate.)

**Lila:** So we have a sequence that is supposed to contain every real in $[0,1]$.

**Acharya Bhaskar:** Right. Now we construct a nested sequence of closed intervals
$$
I_1 \supset I_2 \supset I_3 \supset \cdots
$$
with the property that $x_n \notin I_{n+1}$ for each $n$, and with the lengths $|I_n|$  shrinking to $0$. Start with
$$
I_1 := [0,1].
$$

**Lila:** How do we get $I_2$ from $I_1$ so that it avoids $x_1$?

**Acharya Bhaskar:** Since $x_1$ is a single point in $[0,1]$, we can choose a closed subinterval $I_2 \subset I_1$ that does not contain $x_1$. For definiteness pick $I_2$ to be one of the two halves of $[0,1]$ that does not contain $x_1$ (if $x_1$ is exactly the midpoint, choose a smaller closed subinterval avoiding it). Ensure $|I_2|\le 1/2$.

**Lila:** And then for $x_2$ we choose $I_3 \subset I_2$ avoiding $x_2$, and so on?

**Acharya Bhaskar:** Exactly. Inductively: given $I_n$ (a nonempty closed interval), pick a closed subinterval $I_{n+1}\subset I_n$ such that $x_n\notin I_{n+1}$ and $|I_{n+1}|\le 2^{-n}$. (There is always room to do this because removing the single point $x_n$ from $I_n$ leaves intervals we can choose from; we may take half of $I_n$ away from $x_n$.)

So we obtain a nested sequence of nonempty closed intervals whose lengths tend to zero:
$$
|I_n| \le 2^{-(n-1)} \to 0 \quad (n\to\infty).
$$

**Lila:** Then we use the Nested Interval Property?

**Acharya Bhaskar:** Yes. By NIP, the intersection
$$
\bigcap_{n=1}^{\infty} I_n
$$
is nonempty. Because the lengths $|I_n|$ go to $0$, the intersection contains exactly one point. Call that point $\alpha$.

**Lila:** Now why is $\alpha$ a contradiction?

**Acharya Bhaskar:** Observe: for each $n$ we deliberately ensured $x_n\notin I_{n+1}$. Since $\alpha\in I_{n+1}$ for every $n$, we conclude $\alpha\neq x_n$ for every $n$. Thus $\alpha$ is a point of $[0,1]$ that does not appear in the list $x_1,x_2,\dots$, contradicting the assumption that the list enumerated all reals in $[0,1]$.

Therefore our assumption that $\mathbb{R}$ (equivalently $[0,1]$) is countable is false. Hence $\mathbb{R}$ is uncountable. ‚àé

<details>
<summary><strong>Remark / small alternative detail</strong></summary>

One technical way to ensure the construction works cleanly is to define $I_1=[0,1]$. At step $n$, given the closed interval $I_n=[a_n,b_n]$, choose two closed subintervals
$[a_n,m_n]$ and $[m_n,b_n]$ where $m_n=(a_n+b_n)/2$. At least one of these halves does not contain $x_n$; take that half to be $I_{n+1}$. Then $|I_{n+1}|=\tfrac12|I_n|\le 2^{-n}$, and the lengths go to $0$. The rest of the proof is unchanged.
