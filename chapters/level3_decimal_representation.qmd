# Level 3: Binary and Decimal Representation via [0,1]

**Lila:** Acharya, how about the decimal representation of real numbers? We still don't know how we get that!

**Acharya:** That's a good question Lila! But in order to demonstrate the decinal representation, let us start with the *binary representation* of numbers.
**Lila:** Ah! I have heard that computers use binary numbers to represent data. I am curious how real numbers can be represented using binary numbers. Does it have anything to do with the Nested Intervals Property?
**Acharya Bhaskar:** Excellent thought, Lila. Yes, binary representation can be built by repeatedly bisecting the interval $[0,1]$. Let’s explore.

## Step 1: First division
Take any real number $x \in [0,1]$. Divide $[0,1]$ into two halves:
$$
[0,\tfrac{1}{2}] \quad \text{and} \quad [\tfrac{1}{2}, 1].
$$

- If $x \in [0,\tfrac{1}{2})$, we set $a_1 = 0$.  
- If $x \in [\tfrac{1}{2},1]$, we set $a_1 = 1$.

So the first binary digit $a_1$ tells us whether $x$ lies in the left or right half.

---

**Step 2: Second division**
Now, take the half chosen in Step 1 and bisect it again.

- If $a_1=0$, then we split $[0,\tfrac{1}{2}]$ into $[0,\tfrac{1}{4}]$ and $[\tfrac{1}{4},\tfrac{1}{2}]$.  
- If $a_1=1$, then we split $[\tfrac{1}{2},1]$ into $[\tfrac{1}{2},\tfrac{3}{4}]$ and $[\tfrac{3}{4},1]$.

Depending on which subinterval contains $x$, we assign $a_2=0$ (left) or $a_2=1$ (right).

---

**Lila:** So $a_2$ refines the position of $x$ within the chosen half?

**Acharya Bhaskar:** Exactly. Continuing this process, at the $n$-th step we decide whether $x$ lies in the left or right subinterval, and record the digit $a_n$.

---

Step 3: Infinite process**
Thus we build a sequence of digits $a_1,a_2,a_3,\dots$ where each $a_i \in \{0,1\}$. These digits define the binary expansion:
$$
x = 0.a_1a_2a_3\ldots \quad \text{(in base 2)}.
$$

Formally,
$$
x = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{a_n}{2^n}.
$$

---

**Lila:** Ah, so each digit corresponds to a left-or-right choice in successive subdivisions of $[0,1]$. That’s just like building a nested sequence of intervals!

**Acharya Bhaskar:** Well observed. In fact, the intersection of these nested intervals is exactly the single point $x$. The binary expansion records the entire path of choices.

---

## Step 4: Example
Take $x=\tfrac{5}{8}$.  
- First step: $x\in [\tfrac{1}{2},1]$, so $a_1=1$.  
- Second step: $x\in [\tfrac{1}{2},\tfrac{3}{4}]$, so $a_2=0$.  
- Third step: $x\in [\tfrac{5}{8},\tfrac{3}{4}]$, so $a_3=1$.  

Thus,
$$
x = 0.101_2 = \tfrac{1}{2} + 0 + \tfrac{1}{8} = \tfrac{5}{8}.
$$

---

**Lila:** That’s beautiful! Binary digits are nothing but a record of the successive bisections that trap the number.

**Acharya Bhaskar:** Exactly, and this construction shows how every $x \in [0,1]$ can be encoded as an infinite binary string. It connects the geometry of intervals with the arithmetic of expansions.
