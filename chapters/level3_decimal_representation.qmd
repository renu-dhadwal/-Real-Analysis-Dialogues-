# Level 3: Binary and Decimal Representation via [0,1]

**Lila:** Acharya, what about the decimal representation of real numbers? We still don’t know exactly how it is constructed.

**Acharya Bhaskar:** A very good question, Lila! To understand decimal representations properly, it is helpful to first look at the binary representation of numbers.

**Lila:** Ah! I know that computers use binary numbers to represent data. But I’m curious—how can real numbers be expressed in binary? And does this have any connection with the Nested Interval Property?

**Acharya Bhaskar:** Excellent thought, Lila. Indeed, binary representation arises quite naturally if we repeatedly bisect the interval $[0,1]$. Let’s explore how this works.

## Binary representation

**Step 1:** First division
Take any real number $x \in [0,1]$. Divide $[0,1]$ into two halves:
$$
[0,\tfrac{1}{2}] \quad \text{and} \quad [\tfrac{1}{2}, 1].
$$

- If $x \in [0,\tfrac{1}{2})$, we set $a_1 = 0$.  
- If $x \in [\tfrac{1}{2},1]$, we set $a_1 = 1$.

So the first binary digit $a_1$ tells us whether $x$ lies in the left or right half.

---

**Step 2: Second division**
Now, take the half chosen in Step 1 and bisect it again.

- If $a_1=0$, then we split $[0,\tfrac{1}{2}]$ into $[0,\tfrac{1}{4}]$ and $[\tfrac{1}{4},\tfrac{1}{2}]$.  
- If $a_1=1$, then we split $[\tfrac{1}{2},1]$ into $[\tfrac{1}{2},\tfrac{3}{4}]$ and $[\tfrac{3}{4},1]$.

Depending on which subinterval contains $x$, we assign $a_2=0$ (left) or $a_2=1$ (right).

---

**Lila:** So $a_2$ refines the position of $x$ within the chosen half?

**Acharya Bhaskar:** Exactly. Continuing this process, at the $n$-th step we decide whether $x$ lies in the left or right subinterval, and record the digit $a_n$.

---

**Step 3: Infinite process**
Thus we build a sequence of digits $a_1,a_2,a_3,\dots$ where each $a_i \in \{0,1\}$. These digits define the binary expansion:
$$
x = 0.a_1a_2a_3\ldots \quad \text{(in base 2)}.
$$

Formally,
$$
x = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{a_n}{2^n}.
$$

---

**Lila:** Ah, so each digit corresponds to a left-or-right choice in successive subdivisions of $[0,1]$. That’s just like building a nested sequence of intervals!

**Acharya Bhaskar:** Well observed. In fact, the intersection of these nested intervals is exactly the single point $x$. The binary expansion records the entire path of choices.

---

## Example
Take $x=\tfrac{5}{8}$.  
- First step: $x\in [\tfrac{1}{2},1]$, so $a_1=1$.  
- Second step: $x\in [\tfrac{1}{2},\tfrac{3}{4}]$, so $a_2=0$.  
- Third step: $x\in [\tfrac{5}{8},\tfrac{3}{4}]$, so $a_3=1$.  

Thus,
$$
x = 0.101_2 = \tfrac{1}{2} + 0 + \tfrac{1}{8} = \tfrac{5}{8}.
$$

---

**Lila:** That’s beautiful! Binary digits are nothing but a record of the successive bisections that trap the number.

**Acharya Bhaskar:** Exactly, and this construction shows how every $x \in [0,1]$ can be encoded as an infinite binary string. It connects the geometry of intervals with the arithmetic of expansions.

---

## Decimal Representation via [0,1]

**Lila:** Acharya, now that I understand binary representation, what about *decimal* representation of real numbers? How do we obtain that?

**Acharya Bhaskar:** Very good question, Lila. The idea is very similar to binary, except instead of dividing into two parts, we divide the interval $[0,1]$ into ten equal parts.

---

**First digit**

**Acharya Bhaskar:** Let $x \in [0,1]$. We divide $[0,1]$ into ten subintervals:
$$
\Big[0,\tfrac{1}{10}\Big], \Big[\tfrac{1}{10},\tfrac{2}{10}\Big], \dots, \Big[\tfrac{9}{10},1\Big].
$$

- If $x$ lies in the first interval, set $d_1=0$.  
- If $x$ lies in the second interval, set $d_1=1$.  
- And so on, up to $d_1=9$ if $x \in [\tfrac{9}{10},1]$.  

This $d_1$ is the *first decimal digit* after the point.

**Lila:** So $d_1$ tells us in which tenth of the interval $[0,1]$ the number $x$ lies.

---

**Second digit**

**Acharya Bhaskar:** Exactly. Now, take the subinterval chosen in Step 1 and divide it again into ten equal parts.  

The position of $x$ in this subdivision gives us $d_2$, the second decimal digit.

**Lila:** Just like in binary, but with ten instead of two!

---

**Infinite process**

**Acharya Bhaskar:** Yes. Continuing this process, we construct digits $d_1,d_2,d_3,\dots$ with $d_i \in \{0,1,2,\dots,9\}$.  

These digits define the decimal expansion:
$$
x = 0.d_1d_2d_3\ldots \quad \text{(in base 10)}.
$$

Formally,
$$
x = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{d_n}{10^n}.
$$

---

### Example: Find the decimal repersentation of $x = \tfrac{2}{7}$

- First step: $2/7$ lies in the third subinterval $[2/10,3/10]$, so $d_1=2$.  
- Second step: within $[2/10,3/10]$, divide into tenths: $[28/100,29/100]$ contains $2/7$, so $d_2=8$.  
- Third step: now inside $[28/100,29/100]$, we find $2/7$ in $[285/1000,286/1000]$, so $d_3=5$.  
- Fourth step: inside $[285/1000,286/1000]$, we find $2/7$ in $[2857/10000,2858/10000]$, so $d_4=7$.  

Continuing this way, we uncover the repeating decimal expansion:
$$
\frac{2}{7} = 0.285714285714\ldots
$$

**Lila:** That’s neat! The digits appear directly from locating $x$ in finer and finer tenths.

---

### A subtlety: non-uniqueness

**Lila:** Are decimal representations always unique?

**Acharya Bhaskar:** A very sharp question, Lila. In fact, they are *not always unique*. For example,
$$
0.5000\ldots = 0.4999\ldots
$$
represent the same number.  

**Lila:** Oh, I see. So sometimes a terminating decimal has an alternative representation with repeating $9$s.

**Acharya Bhaskar:** Exactly. This happens whenever the decimal expansion ends. You may think of it as the final subinterval having two possible "addresses" — one ending in an infinite string of zeros, and the other in an infinite string of nines.

**Lila:** So aside from this special case, decimal representations are unique?

**Acharya Bhaskar:** Yes, apart from this subtlety, each real number in $[0,1]$ corresponds to exactly one infinite decimal expansion.

---

**Lila:** That clears it up! Decimal representation is really just like binary, except we use partitions into ten instead of two, with a small quirk about repeating $9$s.

**Acharya Bhaskar:** Exactly, Lila. And this connection between *interval subdivisions* and *digit expansions* is a powerful idea in real analysis.


# Cantor's Diagonal Argument — Uncountability of $[0,1]$

**Lila:** Acharya, please give Cantor’s diagonal proof but using **decimal** expansions.

**Acharya Bhaskar:** Certainly. I will keep the presentation short and rigorous.

---

## A canonical choice of decimal expansion

**Acharya Bhaskar:** First a technical but important point. Some numbers admit two decimal expansions, for example
$$
0.5000\ldots = 0.4999\ldots.
$$
To avoid ambiguity we fix a canonical rule: whenever a number has two decimal expansions, we choose the one that terminates (the expansion ending in infinitely many zeros). Equivalently, we do **not** use expansions that end with an infinite tail of $9$'s.

With this rule, every $x\in[0,1]$ has a unique decimal expansion
$$
x = 0.d_1 d_2 d_3\ldots\qquad (d_i\in\{0,1,\dots,9\}).
$$

---

## Assume a listing

**Acharya Bhaskar:** Suppose, for contradiction, that $[0,1]$ is countable. Then there is a list
$$
x_1,\; x_2,\; x_3,\; \dots
$$
and, by our canonical rule, write each $x_n$ as
$$
x_1 = 0.d_{11} d_{12} d_{13}\ldots d_{1n} \ldots,\\
x_2 = 0.d_{21} d_{22} d_{23}\ldots d_{2n} \ldots,\\
x_3 = 0.d_{31} d_{32} d_{33}\ldots d_{3n} \ldots,\\
\vdots
x_n = 0.d_{n1} d_{n2} d_{n3}\ldots d_{nn} \ldots,
$$
where $d_{nk}\in\{0,\dots,9\}$ is the $k$-th decimal digit of the $n$-th number.

---

## The diagonal construction

**Acharya Bhaskar:** Now build a new decimal sequence $(y_k)$ by changing the $k$-th digit of the $k$-th listed number. For each $k$ define
$$
y_k :=
\begin{cases}
d_{kk}+1 &\text{if } d_{kk}\in\{0,1,\dots,8\},\\[4pt]
0 &\text{if } d_{kk}=9.
\end{cases}
$$
Thus $y_k\in\{0,\dots,9\}$ and, crucially, $y_k\neq d_{kk}$ for every $k$.

Let
$$
y := 0.y_1 y_2 y_3 \ldots .
$$

---

## Why this is a contradiction

**Lila:** How do we know $y$ is not on the list?

**Acharya Bhaskar:** For each $n$, the $n$-th digit of $y$ equals $y_n$, which by construction differs from $d_{nn}$, the $n$-th digit of $x_n$. Therefore $y\neq x_n$ for every $n$. In other words, $y$ is a point of $[0,1]$ not appearing in the supposed complete list. This contradicts the assumption that $[0,1]$ was countable.

Hence $[0,1]$, and therefore $\mathbb{R}$, is uncountable. ∎

---

## Short remarks

- Avoiding the infinite-$9$ expansions was necessary so that each listed number had a unique expansion; our choice of the terminating expansion makes the diagonal flip unambiguous.  
- The same argument works with any base $b\ge2$; in base $b$ choose a digit different from the diagonal one (for example add $1$ modulo $b$) to guarantee the new number differs on every diagonal position.
