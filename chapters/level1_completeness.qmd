# 🌊 Level 1: Completeness of the Real Numbers

**Lila**:  
“Acharya, we already have natural numbers, integers, rationals. Why do we need *real* numbers? Aren’t rationals enough?”

**Acharya Bhaskara**:  
“That is a wise question, Lila. Let us test the rationals. Can you think of a number whose square is 2?”

**Lila**:  
“Well… if I try,  
- $1.4^2 = 1.96$,  
- $1.41^2 = 1.9881$,  
- $1.414^2 = 1.999396$…  
We get closer, but never exactly 2.”

**Acharya Bhaskara**:  
“So, do you think there is a rational number $q$ with $q^2 = 2$?”

**Lila**:  
“No. I’ve seen the proof that $\sqrt{2}$ is irrational.”

**Acharya Bhaskara**:  
“Correct. But notice this: even if $\sqrt{2}$ is not rational, we can approximate it as closely as we like using rationals — $$1.4, 1.41, 1.414\ldots$$ The rationals are *dense*: between any two rationals there is another. Yet something is still missing.”

## 🔹 Boundedness

**Acharya Bhaskara**:  
“Let us capture this rigorously. Consider the set

$$
S = \{ x \in \mathbb{Q} : x^2 < 2 \}.
$$

Is there a number that is always greater than every element of this set?”

**Lila**:  
“Sure, 2 is bigger than all of them. So is 1.5, or 1.42.”

**Acharya Bhaskara**:  
Exactly. We call such numbers *upper bounds*. Here is a precise definition.

::: definition{#def:upper-bound}

**Definition (Upper bound).**  
A number $M$ is an upper bound of a set $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ if
$$
x \leq M \quad \text{for all } x \in S.
$$
:::

Similarly, we can define a *lower bound*.

::: definition{#def:lower-bound}

**Definition (Lower bound).**  
A number $m$ is an upper bound of a set $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ if
$$
x \geq M \quad \text{for all } x \in S.
$$
:::

**Lila**:  
“Acharya, you defined what it means for a number to be an upper bound. But what about the set itself? When do we call a set *bounded*?”

**Acharya Bhaskara**:  
“A good question, Lila. Here is the precise definition.”

::: definition{#def:bounded-set}
**Definition (Bounded Set).**  
A set $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is said to be **bounded above** if it has an upper bound.  
It is **bounded below** if it has a lower bound.  
If $S$ is both bounded above and below, then $S$ is called a **bounded set**.  
Formally, there exist real numbers $m, M \in \mathbb{R}$ such that
$$
m \le x \le M \quad \text{for all } x \in S.
$$

## 🔹 Examples

::: example
**Example 1.**  
The interval [0,1] is bounded above by 1, 2, $\ldots$ and bounded below by 0, -1, $\ldots$.  
In fact, 0 and 1 are the *tightest* bounds, so the set is bounded.
:::

::: example
**Example 2.**  
The set $\mathbb{N} = \{1,2,3,\ldots\}$ is bounded below (by $1, 0, -5, \ldots$),  
but it is **not** bounded above — it grows without end.
:::

::: example
**Example 3.**  
The set $\mathbb{Z}$ of all integers has no upper bound and no lower bound.  
Thus, it is **not** bounded.
:::

**Lila**:  
“So a set is bounded if it fits within some finite interval $[m,M]$ on the number line?”

**Acharya Bhaskara**:  
“Exactly! That’s the intuition — bounded sets live inside some finite cage on the real line.  
Unbounded sets escape that cage, either upward, downward, or both.”

**Acharya Bhaskara**:  
“But among upper bounds some are tighter than others. Which number feels like the ‘tightest’ upper bound for our set $
S = \{ x \in \mathbb{Q} : x^2 < 2 \}.
$?”

**Lila**:  
“It should be $\sqrt{2}$, since that’s where the set stops.”

**Acharya Bhaskara**:  
“Indeed. But here is the problem: $\sqrt{2}$ is not in $\mathbb{Q}$. So the rationals cannot capture the least upper bound of this set.”

---

### 🔹 Supremum

**Acharya Bhaskara**:  
“This brings us to another definition:


::: definition{#def:supremum}
**Definition (Least Upper Bound / Supremum).**  
The **least upper bound** (or **supremum**) of a set $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is the smallest number $M$ such that $M$ is an upper bound of $A$.  
Formally, $M = \sup A$ if
1. $x \leq M$ for all $x \in A$, and  
2. for any $\varepsilon > 0$, there exists $x \in A$ such that $x > M - \varepsilon$.
:::

::: definition{#def:infimum}
**Definition (Greatest Lower Bound / Infimum).**  
The **greatest lower bound** (or **infimum**) of a set $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is the greatest number $m$ such that $m$ is a lower bound of $A$.  
Formally, $m = \inf A$ if
1. $x \geq m$ for all $x \in A$, and  
2. for any $\varepsilon > 0$, there exists $x \in A$ such that $x < m + \varepsilon$.
:::


“So the problem with rationals is that some sets don’t have a supremum inside them?”

**Acharya Bhaskara**:  
“Precisely. The rationals are **dense** but **not complete**. The missing piece is the *completeness property* of the real numbers.”

---

## 🔹 Completeness Axiom

**Acharya Bhaskara**:  
“The defining property of the real numbers is this:

> **Completeness Axiom**: Every nonempty set of real numbers that is bounded above has a least upper bound (supremum) in $\mathbb{R}$.

This axiom is what makes the real line whole.”

---

**Lila**:  
“So for $S = \{ x : x^2 < 2 \}$, the supremum is $\sqrt{2}$, which *does* exist in $\mathbb{R}$.”

**Acharya Bhaskara**:  
“Exactly. And that, Lila, is the difference between rationals and reals. Completeness fills the gaps and makes the real line continuous. Without it, calculus itself would crumble.”

## ✅ Try it yourself

1. (Optional) Give an example of a subset of $\mathbb{Q}$ that is bounded above in $\mathbb{Q}$ but has no least upper bound in $\mathbb{Q}$.
