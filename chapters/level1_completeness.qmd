**Lila**:  
“Acharya, we already have natural numbers, integers, rationals. Why do we need *real* numbers? Aren’t rationals enough?”

**Acharya Bhaskara**:  
“That is a wise question, Lila. Let us test the rationals. Can you think of a number whose square is 2?”

**Lila**:  
“Well… if I try,  
- $1.4^2 = 1.96$,  
- $1.41^2 = 1.9881$,  
- $1.414^2 = 1.999396$…  
We get closer, but never exactly 2.”

**Acharya Bhaskara**:  
“So, do you think there is a rational number $q$ with $q^2 = 2$?”

**Lila**:  
“No. I’ve seen the proof that $\sqrt{2}$ is irrational.”

**Acharya Bhaskara**:  
“Correct. But notice this: even if $\sqrt{2}$ is not rational, we can approximate it as closely as we like using rationals — $1.4, 1.41, 1.414\ldots$ The rationals are *dense*: between any two rationals there is another. Yet something is still missing.”

## 🔹 Boundedness

**Acharya Bhaskara**:  
“Let us capture this rigorously. Consider the set

$$
S = \{ x \in \mathbb{Q} : x^2 < 2 \}.
$$

Is there a number that is always greater than every element of this set?”

**Lila**:  
“Sure, 2 is bigger than all of them. So is 1.5, or 1.42.”

**Acharya Bhaskara**:  
“Exactly. We call such numbers *upper bounds*. Here is a precise definition.”

::: definition{#def:upper-bound}
**Definition (Upper bound).**  
A number $M$ is an **upper bound** of a set $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ if
$$
x \leq M \quad \text{for all } x \in S.
$$
:::

Similarly, we can define a *lower bound*.

::: definition{#def:lower-bound}
**Definition (Lower bound).**  
A number $m$ is a **lower bound** of a set $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ if
$$
x \geq m \quad \text{for all } x \in S.
$$
:::

---

**Lila**:  
“Acharya, you defined what it means for a number to be an upper or lower bound. But what about the set itself? When do we call a set *bounded*?”

**Acharya Bhaskara**:  
“A good question, Lila. Here is the precise definition.”

::: definition{#def:bounded-set}
**Definition (Bounded Set).**  
A set $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is said to be **bounded above** if it has an upper bound.  
It is **bounded below** if it has a lower bound.  
If $S$ is both bounded above and below, then $S$ is called a **bounded set**.  
Formally, there exist real numbers $m, M \in \mathbb{R}$ such that
$$
m \le x \le M \quad \text{for all } x \in S.
$$

## 🔹 Examples

::: example
**Example 1.**  
The interval $[0,1]$ is bounded above by $1, 2, \ldots$ and bounded below by $0, -1, \ldots$.  
In fact, $0$ and $1$ are the *tightest* bounds, so the set is bounded.
:::

::: example
**Example 2.**  
The set $\mathbb{N} = \{1,2,3,\ldots\}$ is bounded below (by $1, 0, -5, \ldots$),  
but it is **not** bounded above — it grows without end.
:::

::: example
**Example 3.**  
The set $\mathbb{Z}$ of all integers has no upper bound and no lower bound.  
Thus, it is **not** bounded.
:::

**Lila**:  
“So a set is bounded if it fits within some finite interval $[m,M]$ on the number line?”

**Acharya Bhaskara**:  
“Exactly! That’s the intuition — bounded sets live inside some finite cage on the real line.  
Unbounded sets escape that cage, either upward, downward, or both.”

**Acharya Bhaskara**:  
“But among upper bounds some are tighter than others. Which number feels like the ‘tightest’ upper bound for our set  
$$
S = \{ x \in \mathbb{Q} : x^2 < 2 \}?
$$”

**Lila**:  
“It should be $\sqrt{2}$, since that’s where the set stops.”

**Acharya Bhaskara**:  
“Indeed. But here is the problem: $\sqrt{2}$ is not in $\mathbb{Q}$. So the rationals cannot capture the least upper bound of this set.”

---

## 🔹 Supremum

**Acharya Bhaskara**:  
“This brings us to another definition:”

::: definition{#def:supremum}
**Definition (Least Upper Bound / Supremum).**  
Let $A$ be a nonempty subset of $\mathbb{R}$.  
If $A$ is bounded above, then a number $M$ is said to be the **supremum** (least upper bound) of $A$ if:

1. $x \le M$ for all $x \in A$, and  
2. for any $\varepsilon > 0$, there exists $x \in A$ such that $x > M - \varepsilon$.
:::

::: definition{#def:infimum}
**Definition (Greatest Lower Bound / Infimum).**  
Let $A$ be a nonempty subset of $\mathbb{R}$.  
If $A$ is bounded below, then a number $m$ is said to be the **infimum** (greatest lower bound) of $A$ if:

1. $m \le x$ for all $x \in A$, and  
2. for any $\varepsilon > 0$, there exists $x \in A$ such that $x < m + \varepsilon$.
:::

**Lila**:  
“So the problem with rationals is that some sets don’t have a supremum inside them?”

**Acharya Bhaskara**:  
“Precisely. The rationals are **dense** but **not complete**. The missing piece is the *completeness property* of the real numbers.”

---

## 🔹 Completeness Axiom

**Acharya Bhaskara**:  
“The defining property of the real numbers is this:

> **Completeness Axiom**: Every nonempty set of real numbers that is bounded above has a least upper bound (supremum) in $\mathbb{R}$.

This axiom is what makes the real line whole.”

---

**Lila**:  
“So for $S = \{ x : x^2 < 2 \}$, the supremum is $\sqrt{2}$, which *does* exist in $\mathbb{R}$.”

**Acharya Bhaskara**:  
“Exactly. And that, Lila, is the difference between rationals and reals. Completeness fills the gaps and makes the real line continuous. Without it, calculus itself would crumble.”

---

## ✅ Try it yourself

1. (Optional) Give an example of a subset of $\mathbb{Q}$ that is bounded above in $\mathbb{Q}$ but has no least upper bound in $\mathbb{Q}$.

---

## Proofs

**Acharya Bhaskara**:  
“Dear Lila, it is not enough that we make statements about numbers. We need to **prove** them too!”

**Lila**:  
“But Acharya, why do we need to prove them? If something feels obviously true, can’t we just accept it?”

**Acharya Bhaskara**:  
“Ah, that is the difference between intuition and mathematics. Intuition is helpful, but it can also mislead us. Proofs are what give mathematics its certainty. Without proof, we have only belief. With proof, we have knowledge.”

**Lila**:  
“Can you give me an example?”

**Acharya Bhaskara**:  
“Certainly. Take the statement: *‘The square root of 2 is irrational.’* Long ago, many believed that every number was a fraction. But through proof, we know with certainty that $\sqrt{2}$ cannot be expressed as $\tfrac{p}{q}$ with integers $p$ and $q$.”

**Lila**:  
“I see — so proofs are like the backbone that holds mathematics upright.”

**Acharya Bhaskara**:  
“Exactly! Proofs force us to use definitions carefully and follow logical steps. They protect us from hidden assumptions. And, more importantly, they reveal *why* a statement is true, not just *that* it is true.”

**Lila**:  
“So every time we state something in real analysis — like that every bounded set has a supremum — we must also prove it?”

**Acharya Bhaskara**:  
“Indeed. That completeness axiom we discussed is itself an assumption. But once accepted, we must prove all consequences from it rigorously. That is the art of analysis: building a tower of truth, brick by brick, proof by proof.”

## Worked Example: Supremum and Infimum of $(0,1)$

**Lila**:  
“Acharya, can we apply these definitions right away? Let’s take the open interval $S = (0,1)$. What are $\sup S$ and $\inf S$?”

**Acharya Bhaskara**:  
“Excellent! Let’s prove that $\sup S = 1$ and $\inf S = 0$.”

::: proof
**Proof.**  
Let $S = (0,1)$.

1. **Supremum.**  
   - *Upper bound:* For every $x \in S$, we have $x < 1$, so $1$ is an upper bound.  
   - *Leastness:* Suppose $M < 1$. Then choose  
     $$
     x = \tfrac{M+1}{2}.
     $$
     Clearly $0 < x < 1$, so $x \in S$, but $x > M$.  
     Thus $M$ is not an upper bound.  
   Hence, $\sup S = 1$.

2. **Infimum.**  
   - *Lower bound:* For every $x \in S$, we have $x > 0$, so $0$ is a lower bound.  
   - *Greatestness:* Suppose $m > 0$. Then choose  
     $$
     x = \tfrac{m}{2}.
     $$
     Since $0 < x < m$, we have $x \in S$ but $x < m$.  
     Thus $m$ is not a lower bound.  
   Hence, $\inf S = 0$.
:::

---

**Lila**:  
“So the trick was to show that $1$ works as an upper bound, but anything smaller fails.”

**Acharya Bhaskara**:  
“Exactly, Lila. That is the essence of supremum proofs: two steps — upper bound, and leastness. Once you master this structure, many proofs in analysis will follow the same pattern.”

**Lila**:  
“So even though neither $0$ nor $1$ are in the set $(0,1)$, they still serve as its infimum and supremum?”

**Acharya Bhaskara**:  
“Exactly! That’s one of the key ideas in real analysis: bounds need not belong to the set itself. Supremum and infimum live in the real line, not necessarily inside the set.”

## 🔹 Density

**Lila**:  
“Acharya, earlier you said the rationals are *dense*. What exactly does that mean?”

**Acharya Bhaskara**:  
“Good question, Lila. Let me give you the formal definition.”

::: definition{#def:dense}
**Definition (Density).**  
A subset $D \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is said to be **dense in $\mathbb{R}$** if  
for every pair of real numbers $a,b$ with $a < b$, there exists $x \in D$ such that
$$
a < x < b.
$$
:::

**Lila**:  
“So, no matter how small the interval, there’s always a rational inside it?”

**Acharya Bhaskara**:  
“Exactly! The rationals $\mathbb{Q}$ are dense in $\mathbb{R}$.  
In contrast, the integers $\mathbb{Z}$ are **not** dense, because between two consecutive integers, like $2$ and $3$, no integer lies strictly in between.”
## 🔹 Example: Rationals are Dense

**Lila**:  
“Acharya, can we prove that the rationals are really dense in $\mathbb{R}$?”

**Acharya Bhaskara**:  
“Of course. This is a fundamental fact: between any two real numbers, there lies a rational.”

---

::: proof
**Proof.**  
Let $a,b \in \mathbb{R}$ with $a < b$.  
We need to show there exists a rational $q \in \mathbb{Q}$ such that $a < q < b$.

Since $b-a > 0$, by the Archimedean Property there exists a natural number $n$ such that
$$
\frac{1}{n} < b - a.
$$

Now consider the integers $k$ satisfying
$$
k > a n.
$$
Let $k$ be the smallest such integer.  
Then
$$
k-1 \le a n < k.
$$
Dividing by $n$ gives
$$
\frac{k-1}{n} \le a < \frac{k}{n}.
$$

So $\tfrac{k}{n}$ is a rational number greater than $a$.  
Moreover, since $\tfrac{1}{n} < b-a$, we have
$$
\frac{k}{n} < a + \frac{1}{n} < b.
$$

Thus
$$
a < \frac{k}{n} < b,
$$
and $\frac{k}{n} \in \mathbb{Q}$ lies strictly between $a$ and $b$.

Therefore, $\mathbb{Q}$ is dense in $\mathbb{R}$.
:::

**Lila**:  
“So we used the Archimedean Property to trap a rational in between $a$ and $b$!”

**Acharya Bhaskara**:  
“Exactly. This proof not only shows that rationals are dense, it also highlights how the structure of the real numbers — via the Archimedean Property — guarantees their richness.”
