# Real Analysis Dialogues

Drop these files into a new GitHub repo (or upload via the web UI) and then use Quarto locally to render.

Files included:
- _quarto.yml
- index.qmd
- chapters/level1_completeness.qmd
- chapters/level2_intervals.qmd
- chapters/level3_decimal_representation.qmd
- styles/course.css
