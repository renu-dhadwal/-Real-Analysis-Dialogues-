    "text": "2.1 🔹 Boundedness\nLila:\n“Acharya, we already have natural numbers, integers, rationals. Why do we need real numbers? Aren’t rationals enough?”\nAcharya Bhaskara:\n“That is a wise question, Lila. Let us test the rationals. Can you think of a number whose square is 2?”\nLila:\n“Well… if I try,\n- \\(1.4^2 = 1.96\\),\n- \\(1.41^2 = 1.9881\\),\n- \\(1.414^2 = 1.999396\\)…\nWe get closer, but never exactly 2.”\nAcharya Bhaskara:\n“So, do you think there is a rational number \\(q\\) with \\(q^2 = 2\\)?”\nLila:\n“No. I’ve seen the proof that \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) is irrational.”\nAcharya Bhaskara:\n“Correct. But notice this: even if \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) is not rational, we can approximate it as closely as we like using rationals — \\(1.4, 1.41, 1.414\\ldots\\) The rationals are dense: between any two rationals there is another. Yet something is still missing.”\nAcharya Bhaskara:\n“Let us capture this rigorously. Consider the set\n\\[\nS = \\{ x \\in \\mathbb{Q} : x^2 &lt; 2 \\}.\n\\]\nIs there a number that is always greater than every element of this set?”\nLila:\n“Sure, 2 is bigger than all of them. So is 1.5, or 1.42.”\nAcharya Bhaskara:\n“Exactly. We call such numbers upper bounds. Here is a precise definition.”\nSimilarly, we can define a lower bound.\nLila:\n“Acharya, you defined what it means for a number to be an upper or lower bound. But what about the set itself? When do we call a set bounded?”\nAcharya Bhaskara:\n“A good question, Lila. Here is the precise definition.”",

Proofs are what give mathematics its certainty. Without proof, we have only belief. With proof, we have knowledge.”\nLila:\n“Can you give me an example?”\nAcharya Bhaskara:\n“Certainly. Take the statement: ‘The square root of 2 is irrational.’ Long ago, many believed that every number was a fraction. But through proof, we know with certainty that \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) cannot be expressed as \\(\\tfrac{p}{q}\\) with integers \\(p\\) and \\(q\\).”\nLila:\n“I see — so proofs are like the backbone that holds mathematics upright.”\nAcharya Bhaskara:\n“Exactly! Proofs force us to use definitions carefully and follow logical steps. They protect us from hidden assumptions. And, more importantly, they reveal why a statement is true, not just that it is true.”\nLila:\n“So every time we state something in real analysis — like that every bounded set has a supremum — we must also prove it?”\nAcharya Bhaskara:\n“Indeed.

The rationals \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) are dense in \\(\\mathbb{R}\\).\nIn contrast, the integers \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) are not dense, because between two consecutive integers, like \\(2\\) and \\(3\\), no integer lies strictly in between.” ## 🔹 Example: Rationals are Dense\nLila:\n“Acharya, can we prove that the rationals are really dense in \\(\\mathbb{R}\\)?”\nAcharya Bhaskara:\n“Of course. This is a fundamental fact: between any two real numbers, there lies a rational.”\n\n\nProof. Proof.\nLet \\(a,b \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) with \\(a &lt; b\\).\nWe need to show there exists a rational \\(q \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\) such that \\(a &lt; q &lt; b\\).\nSince \\(b-a &gt; 0\\), by the Archimedean Property there exists a natural number \\(n\\) such that \\[\n\\frac{1}{n} &lt; b - a.\n\\]\nNow consider the integers \\(k\\) satisfying \\[\nk &gt; a n.\n\\] Let \\(k\\) be the smallest such integer.\nThen \\[\nk-1 \\le a n &lt; k.\n\\] Dividing by \\(n\\) gives \\[\n\\frac{k-1}{n} \\le a &lt; \\frac{k}{n}.\n\\]\nSo \\(\\tfrac{k}{n}\\) is a rational number greater than \\(a\\).\nMoreover, since \\(\\tfrac{1}{n} &lt; b-a\\), we have \\[\n\\frac{k}{n} &lt; a + \\frac{1}{n} &lt; b.\n\\]\nThus \\[\na &lt; \\frac{k}{n} &lt; b,\n\\] and \\(\\frac{k}{n} \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\) lies strictly between \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\nTherefore, \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) is dense in \\(\\mathbb{R}\\).\n\n\nLila:\n“So we used the Archimedean Property to trap a rational in between \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)!”\nAcharya Bhaskara:\n“Exactly.

Divide \\([0,1]\\) into two halves: \\[\n[0,\\tfrac{1}{2}] \\quad \\text{and} \\quad [\\tfrac{1}{2}, 1].\n\\]\nSo the first binary digit \\(a_1\\) tells us whether \\(x\\) lies in the left or right half.\nStep 2: Second division Now, take the half chosen in Step 1 and bisect it again.\nDepending on which subinterval contains \\(x\\), we assign \\(a_2=0\\) (left) or \\(a_2=1\\) (right).\nLila: So \\(a_2\\) refines the position of \\(x\\) within the chosen half?\nAcharya Bhaskar: Exactly. Continuing this process, at the \\(n\\)-th step we decide whether \\(x\\) lies in the left or right subinterval, and record the digit \\(a_n\\).\nStep 3: Infinite process Thus we build a sequence of digits \\(a_1,a_2,a_3,\\dots\\) where each \\(a_i \\in \\{0,1\\}\\). These digits define the binary expansion: \\[\nx = 0.a_1a_2a_3\\ldots \\quad \\text{(in base 2)}.\n\\]\nFormally, \\[\nx = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{a_n}{2^n}.\n\\]\nLila: Ah, so each digit corresponds to a left-or-right choice in successive subdivisions of \\([0,1]\\). That’s just like building a nested sequence of intervals!\nAcharya Bhaskar: Well observed. In fact, the intersection of these nested intervals is exactly the single point \\(x\\). The binary expansion records the entire path of choices.",

    "text": "4.3 Decimal Representation via [0,1]\nLila: Acharya, now that I understand binary representation, what about decimal representation of real numbers? How do we obtain that?\nAcharya Bhaskar: Very good question, Lila. The idea is very similar to binary, except instead of dividing into two parts, we divide the interval \\([0,1]\\) into ten equal parts.\n\nFirst digit\nAcharya Bhaskar: Let \\(x \\in [0,1]\\). We divide \\([0,1]\\) into ten subintervals: \\[\n\\Big[0,\\tfrac{1}{10}\\Big], \\Big[\\tfrac{1}{10},\\tfrac{2}{10}\\Big], \\dots, \\Big[\\tfrac{9}{10},1\\Big].\n\\]\n\nIf \\(x\\) lies in the first interval, set \\(d_1=0\\).\n\nIf \\(x\\) lies in the second interval, set \\(d_1=1\\).\n\nAnd so on, up to \\(d_1=9\\) if \\(x \\in [\\tfrac{9}{10},1]\\).\n\nThis \\(d_1\\) is the first decimal digit after the point.\nLila: So \\(d_1\\) tells us in which tenth of the interval \\([0,1]\\) the number \\(x\\) lies.\n\nSecond digit\nAcharya Bhaskar: Exactly. Now, take the subinterval chosen in Step 1 and divide it again into ten equal parts.\nThe position of \\(x\\) in this subdivision gives us \\(d_2\\), the second decimal digit.\nLila: Just like in binary, but with ten instead of two!\n\nInfinite process\nAcharya Bhaskar: Yes. Continuing this process, we construct digits \\(d_1,d_2,d_3,\\dots\\) with \\(d_i \\in \\{0,1,2,\\dots,9\\}\\).\nThese digits define the decimal expansion: \\[\nx = 0.d_1d_2d_3\\ldots \\quad \\text{(in base 10)}.\n\\]\nFormally, \\[\nx = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{d_n}{10^n}.\n\\]\n\n\n4.3.1 Example: Find the decimal repersentation of \\(x = \\tfrac{2}{7}\\)\n\nFirst step: \\(2/7\\) lies in the third subinterval \\([2/10,3/10]\\), so \\(d_1=2\\).\n\nSecond step: within \\([2/10,3/10]\\), divide into tenths: \\([28/100,29/100]\\) contains \\(2/7\\), so \\(d_2=8\\).\n\nThird step: now inside \\([28/100,29/100]\\), we find \\(2/7\\) in \\([285/1000,286/1000]\\), so \\(d_3=5\\).\n\nFourth step: inside \\([285/1000,286/1000]\\), we find \\(2/7\\) in \\([2857/10000,2858/10000]\\), so \\(d_4=7\\).\n\nContinuing this way, we uncover the repeating decimal expansion: \\[\n\\frac{2}{7} = 0.285714285714\\ldots\n\\]\nLila: That’s neat! The digits appear directly from locating \\(x\\) in finer and finer tenths.\n\n\n\n4.3.2 A subtlety: non-uniqueness\nLila: Are decimal representations always unique?\nAcharya Bhaskar: A very sharp question, Lila. In fact, they are not always unique. For example, \\[\n0.5000\\ldots = 0.4999\\ldots\n\\] represent the same number.\nLila: Oh, I see. So sometimes a terminating decimal has an alternative representation with repeating \\(9\\)s.\nAcharya Bhaskar: Exactly. This happens whenever the decimal expansion ends. You may think of it as the final subinterval having two possible “addresses” — one ending in an infinite string of zeros, and the other in an infinite string of nines.\nLila: So aside from this special case, decimal representations are unique?\nAcharya Bhaskar: Yes, apart from this subtlety, each real number in \\([0,1]\\) corresponds to exactly one infinite decimal expansion.\n\nLila: That clears it up! Decimal representation is really just like binary, except we use partitions into ten instead of two, with a small quirk about repeating \\(9\\)s.\nAcharya Bhaskar: Exactly, Lila. And this connection between interval subdivisions and digit expansions is a powerful idea in real analysis.",

    "text": "5.4 Why study sequences and series?\nLila: Why are these so important?\nAcharya Bhaskar: Because they are the language of approximation and analysis: 1. Important numbers like \\(e\\) and \\(\\pi\\) appear as limits of sequences or sums of series.\n2. Functions like \\(\\sin x\\), \\(\\cos x\\), and \\(e^x\\) can be expressed as infinite series — that’s how we calculate them on computers!\n3. Understanding limits of sequences helps us define continuity, derivatives, and integrals.\nLila: So sequences and series are the foundation stones for the rest of calculus and analysis.\nAcharya Bhaskar: Precisely. Real analysis begins here, with the careful study of how infinite processes behave.\n\nAcharya Bhaskar (teaser):\n“Think of a sequence as footsteps marching towards a destination.\nIf the footsteps wander endlessly, the sequence diverges.\nIf they march steadily towards a point, the sequence converges.\nAnd when you add the footsteps together, you create the story of a series.”\n## Limits of Sequences\nLila: Acharya, you said some sequences “converge” and some “diverge.” What exactly does it mean for a sequence to converge?\nAcharya Bhaskar: Good question, Lila. Intuitively, a sequence converges if its terms get closer and closer to some fixed number, which we call the limit.\nLila: So for \\(a_n = \\tfrac{1}{n}\\), the terms \\(1, \\tfrac{1}{2}, \\tfrac{1}{3}, \\dots\\) get closer and closer to \\(0\\), so the limit should be \\(0\\)?\nAcharya Bhaskar: Exactly. We write \\[\n\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\frac{1}{n} = 0.\n\\]\n\n\n5.4.1 The formal definition\nAcharya Bhaskar: But in real analysis we need precision. So here is the definition:\nA sequence \\((a_n)\\) is said to converge to a number \\(L\\) if for every \\(\\varepsilon &gt; 0\\), there exists a natural number \\(K(\\varepsilon)\\) such that whenever \\(n \\geq K(\\varepsilon)\\), we have \\[\n|a_n - L| &lt; \\varepsilon.\n\\]\nLila: Let me see if I understand. This means: no matter how small an error margin \\(\\varepsilon\\) I choose, if I go far enough in the sequence (beyond some \\(K\\) that depends on the given \\(\\varepsilon\\)), all terms stay within that margin around \\(L\\).\nAcharya Bhaskar: Well said. That is the precise meaning of convergence.\n\nExample: \\(a_n = \\tfrac{1}{n}\\)\nLila: Could we test this definition with \\(a_n = \\tfrac{1}{n}\\) and \\(L=0\\)?\nAcharya Bhaskar: Certainly.\nWe want: for every \\(\\varepsilon&gt;0\\), find \\(K(\\varepsilon)\\) such that if \\(n\\ge K(\\varepsilon)\\), then \\(|\\tfrac{1}{n} - 0| &lt; \\varepsilon\\).\nBut \\(|\\tfrac{1}{n} - 0| = \\tfrac{1}{n}\\).\nSo we require \\(\\tfrac{1}{n} &lt; \\varepsilon\\).\nThis is the same as \\(n &gt; \\tfrac{1}{\\varepsilon}\\).\nSo if we choose \\(K(\\varepsilon) = \\lceil \\tfrac{1}{\\varepsilon}\\rceil\\), then for all \\(n\\ge K(\\varepsilon)\\), the condition is satisfied.\nLila: That works! So the formal definition confirms that \\(\\tfrac{1}{n} \\to 0\\).\n\nExample: \\(a_n = (-1)^n\\)\nLila: And what about \\(a_n = (-1)^n\\)?\nAcharya Bhaskar: Then the terms alternate \\(-1, 1, -1, 1, \\dots\\). Do they get closer to a single value?\nLila: No — they keep jumping back and forth. So this sequence does not converge.\nAcharya Bhaskar: Correct. It diverges, because there is no single \\(L\\) that the terms approach.\n\n\n\n5.4.2 Why limits matter\nLila: So convergence is about sequences approaching a fixed target. But why is this so important?\nAcharya Bhaskar: Because the notion of limit is the cornerstone of analysis. Continuity, derivatives, integrals, and infinite series all depend on it. Mastering limits of sequences is the first step toward the deeper structures of calculus.\nLimit of a function via sequences\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteConnecting sequence limits and function limits\n\n\n\n\n\nLila: Acharya, I understand the limit of a sequence. But what could the limit of sequences have to do with the notion of limits of functions?\nAcharya Bhaskar: An excellent question, Lila. In fact, the two ideas are deeply connected.\nWe say \\[\n\\lim_{x\\to a} f(x) = L\n\\] if and only if for every sequence \\((x_n)\\) with \\(x_n \\to a\\) and \\(x_n \\neq a\\), the sequence \\((f(x_n))\\) converges to \\(L\\).\n\nLila: So if all possible sequences approaching \\(a\\) give the same limiting value \\(L\\) for \\(f(x_n)\\), then that must be the limit of the function?\nAcharya Bhaskar: Exactly. This is called the sequential criterion for functional limits.\nIt tells us: instead of thinking about all the infinitely many “ways” of approaching \\(a\\), it is enough to test every possible sequence converging to \\(a\\).\n\nLila: Ah! So the concept of a function limit is really an extension of the idea of sequence limits.\nAcharya Bhaskar: Precisely, Lila. That is why we first built a strong foundation with sequences — they are the key to understanding limits of functions.\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4.3 Another Example of Convergence\nLila: We proved earlier that \\(\\lim \\tfrac{1}{n} = 0\\). Could you show me another example, maybe a slightly different sequence?\nAcharya Bhaskar: Certainly! Let’s consider the sequence\n\\[x_n = \\frac{1}{n^2+1}.\\] I claim that \\(\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} x_n = 0\\).\nLila: Oh, it looks similar to \\(\\tfrac{1}{n}\\), but the denominator grows even faster. So it should also go to zero, right?\nAcharya Bhaskar: Exactly. Let’s do a rigorous \\(\\varepsilon\\)–\\(N\\) proof.\n\n\nClick to see the proof\n\nWe want to show that for every \\(\\varepsilon &gt; 0\\), there exists \\(N \\in \\mathbb{N}\\) such that for all \\(n &gt; N\\),\n\\[\\Bigg|\\frac{1}{n^2+1} - 0\\Bigg| &lt; \\varepsilon.\\]\nBut\n\\[\\Bigg|\\frac{1}{n^2+1}\\Bigg| = \\frac{1}{n^2+1}.\\]\nNotice that\n\\[\\frac{1}{n^2+1} &lt; \\frac{1}{n^2}.\\]\nSo it is enough to require\n\\[\\frac{1}{n^2} &lt; \\varepsilon.\\]\nThis means\n\\[n^2 &gt; \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}, \\quad \\text{or equivalently} \\quad n &gt; \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\varepsilon}}.\\]\nThus, if we choose\n\\[N = \\left\\lceil \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\varepsilon}} \\right\\rceil,\\]\nthen for all \\(n &gt; N\\),\n\\[\\frac{1}{n^2+1} &lt; \\varepsilon.\\]\nHence,\n\\[\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{n^2+1} = 0.\\]\n\nLila: That was neat! So the idea is the same as before, but we had to be careful with the square root this time.\nAcharya Bhaskar: Exactly. You’ll see that many convergence proofs follow a similar structure. The challenge is usually in rearranging inequalities smartly.\n\n\n\n5.4.4 A Non–Zero Limit Example\nLila: So far, the examples we’ve done all go to zero. Can you show me a sequence that converges to something other than zero?\nAcharya Bhaskar: Of course. Let’s look at\n\\[x_n = \\frac{n}{n+1}.\\]\nI claim that\n\\[\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{n}{n+1} = 1.\\]\nLila: Hmm… when \\(n\\) is large, \\(n+1\\) is almost the same as \\(n\\), so \\(\\tfrac{n}{n+1}\\) should be almost \\(1\\).\nAcharya Bhaskar: Exactly. Now let’s prove it formally.\n\n\nClick to see the proof\n\nWe want to show: for every \\(\\varepsilon &gt; 0\\), there exists \\(N \\in \\mathbb{N}\\) such that for all \\(n &gt; N\\),\n\\[\\Bigg|\\frac{n}{n+1} - 1\\Bigg| &lt; \\varepsilon.\\]\nSimplify the difference:\n\\[\\Bigg|\\frac{n}{n+1} - 1\\Bigg| = \\Bigg|\\frac{n - (n+1)}{n+1}\\Bigg| = \\frac{1}{n+1}.\\]\nSo we need\n\\[\\frac{1}{n+1} &lt; \\varepsilon.\\]\nThat is,\n\\[n+1 &gt; \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon} \\quad \\implies \\quad n &gt; \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon} - 1.\\]\nThus, if we choose\n\\[N = \\left\\lceil \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon} - 1 \\right\\rceil,\\]\nthen for all \\(n &gt; N\\),\n\\[\\Bigg|\\frac{n}{n+1} - 1\\Bigg| &lt; \\varepsilon.\\]\nTherefore,\n\\[\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{n}{n+1} = 1.\\]\n\nLila: That was nice! The sequence actually climbs closer and closer to \\(1\\), never quite reaching it, but the proof shows it really does converge there.\nAcharya Bhaskar: Exactly. This illustrates an important point — limits don’t always have to be zero; the same method works for any real number.\n\n\n5.4.5 Convergence to a Rational Number\nLila: We’ve seen limits going to \\(0\\) and \\(1\\). Can a sequence converge to some other fraction, like \\(\\tfrac{2}{5}\\)?\nAcharya Bhaskar: Absolutely! Let’s take\n\\[x_n = \\frac{2n+3}{5n+1}.\\]\nI claim that\n\\[\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{2n+3}{5n+1} = \\frac{2}{5}.\\]\nLila: I can guess why — the higher powers of \\(n\\) dominate, so it’s like \\(\\tfrac{2n}{5n} = \\tfrac{2}{5}\\) when \\(n\\) is large.\nAcharya Bhaskar: That’s the intuition. Let’s now prove it rigorously.\n\n\nClick to see the proof\n\nWe want to show: for every \\(\\varepsilon &gt; 0\\), there exists \\(N \\in \\mathbb{N}\\) such that for all \\(n &gt; N\\),\n\\[\\Bigg|\\frac{2n+3}{5n+1} - \\frac{2}{5}\\Bigg| &lt; \\varepsilon.\\]\nSimplify the difference:\n\\[\n\\frac{2n+3}{5n+1} - \\frac{2}{5}\n= \\frac{5(2n+3) - 2(5n+1)}{5(5n+1)}\n= \\frac{10n+15 - 10n - 2}{25n+5}\n= \\frac{13}{25n+5}.\n\\]\nSo\n\\[\\Bigg|\\frac{2n+3}{5n+1} - \\frac{2}{5}\\Bigg| = \\frac{13}{25n+5}.\\]\nNow, we want\n\\[\\frac{13}{25n+5} &lt; \\varepsilon.\\]\nThis inequality is equivalent to\n\\[25n+5 &gt; \\frac{13}{\\varepsilon} \\quad \\implies \\quad n &gt; \\frac{13}{25\\varepsilon} - \\frac{1}{5}.\\]\nSo we can choose\n\\[N = \\left\\lceil \\frac{13}{25\\varepsilon} - \\frac{1}{5} \\right\\rceil.\\]\nThen for all \\(n &gt; N\\), we have\n\\[\\Bigg|\\frac{2n+3}{5n+1} - \\frac{2}{5}\\Bigg| &lt; \\varepsilon.\\]\nTherefore,\n\\[\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{2n+3}{5n+1} = \\frac{2}{5}.\\]\n\nLila: I see! The algebra looks a bit longer, but the same method works. The main trick was simplifying the difference.\nAcharya Bhaskar: Precisely. Once you bring it into a simple form, the \\(\\varepsilon\\)–\\(N\\) argument falls into place. This shows that sequences can converge to any real number, not just \\(0\\) or \\(1\\).\n\n\n5.4.6 An Example of Divergence\nLila: All the examples so far show sequences settling to a finite number. But what about a sequence that doesn’t converge?\nAcharya Bhaskar: Excellent question. Consider the sequence\n\\[x_n = n.\\]\nLila: That just grows bigger and bigger! So it can’t converge to a real number, right?\nAcharya Bhaskar: Exactly. Formally, we say it diverges to infinity. Let’s make this precise.\n\n\nClick to see the explanation\n\nTo say that \\(\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} x_n = +\\infty\\) means:\nFor every real number \\(M &gt; 0\\), there exists \\(N \\in \\mathbb{N}\\) such that for all \\(n &gt; N\\),\n\\[x_n &gt; M.\\]\nNow, since \\(x_n = n\\), if you give me any \\(M &gt; 0\\), I can simply choose\n\\[N = \\lceil M \\rceil.\\]\nThen for all \\(n &gt; N\\), clearly \\(n &gt; M\\), so \\(x_n &gt; M\\).\nThus, the sequence \\(\\{n\\}\\) does not converge to a finite limit, but instead diverges to infinity.\n\nLila: So divergence isn’t just “no limit at all.” Sometimes it means the sequence goes off to infinity in a systematic way.\nAcharya Bhaskar: Exactly. There are also examples where sequences oscillate and fail to have any limit at all — those are divergent in a different sense.\n\n\n5.4.7 An Oscillating Divergent Sequence\nLila: You said some sequences can diverge by oscillating. Can you show me an example?\nAcharya Bhaskar: Certainly. Consider the sequence\n\\[x_n = (-1)^n.\\]\nLila: Oh, so it goes like \\(-1, +1, -1, +1, \\dots\\) That never settles down to a single number.\nAcharya Bhaskar: Exactly. Let’s explain why it does not converge.\n\n\nClick to see the explanation\n\nSuppose, for contradiction, that \\(\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} (-1)^n = L\\) for some real number \\(L\\).\nThen by the definition of convergence, for every \\(\\varepsilon &gt; 0\\) there should be an \\(N\\) such that for all \\(n &gt; N\\),\n\\[|(-1)^n - L| &lt; \\varepsilon.\\]\nBut notice:\n- If \\(n\\) is even, \\((-1)^n = 1\\).\n- If \\(n\\) is odd, \\((-1)^n = -1\\).\nSo the sequence keeps jumping between \\(1\\) and \\(-1\\), no matter how large \\(n\\) becomes.\nFor example, if we take \\(\\varepsilon = \\tfrac{1}{2}\\), then the condition requires all terms \\((-1)^n\\) to lie within an interval of radius \\(\\tfrac{1}{2}\\) around \\(L\\).\nBut one subsequence is constantly \\(1\\), and the other is constantly \\(-1\\). These two points are \\(2\\) units apart, which is much larger than \\(\\tfrac{1}{2}\\).\nTherefore, no single \\(L\\) can satisfy the definition. The sequence does not converge.\n\nLila: I see! Unlike \\(n\\), which runs off to infinity, this one just keeps bouncing forever without settling.\nAcharya Bhaskar: Precisely. These two examples : \\(x_n = n\\) and \\(x_n = (-1)^n\\), illustrate two common ways in which sequences can fail to converge.\n\n\n5.4.8 Summary of Examples\nIn this section, we explored several examples to understand the behavior of sequences:\n\nSome sequences converge to zero, such as \\(\\tfrac{1}{n}\\) and \\(\\tfrac{1}{n^2+1}\\).\n\nOthers converge to non-zero finite limits, like \\(\\tfrac{n}{n+1} \\to 1\\) and \\(\\tfrac{2n+3}{5n+1} \\to \\tfrac{2}{5}\\).\n\nNot all sequences converge:\n\n\\(\\{n\\}\\) diverges to infinity, growing without bound.\n\n\\(\\{(-1)^n\\}\\) oscillates, never settling to a single value.\n\n\nThese examples show that sequences may approach a finite limit, grow without bound, or fail to settle altogether. In each case, the precise \\(\\varepsilon\\)–\\(N\\) definition helps us make these ideas rigorous.\n\n\n5.4.9 Key Techniques for Proving Limits of Sequences\nWhen proving convergence (or divergence), these strategies are especially useful:\n\nInequality comparison:\nShow \\(|x_n - L|\\) is bounded above by a simpler expression that you can control.\nExample: \\(\\tfrac{1}{n^2+1} &lt; \\tfrac{1}{n^2}\\).\nAlgebraic simplification:\nRearrange the difference \\(x_n - L\\) into a form where \\(n\\) appears in the denominator.\nExample: \\(\\tfrac{n}{n+1} - 1 = \\tfrac{-1}{n+1}\\).\nDominant term analysis:\nFor rational functions of \\(n\\), compare the highest powers of \\(n\\) in numerator and denominator.\nExample: \\(\\tfrac{2n+3}{5n+1} \\to \\tfrac{2}{5}\\).\nDivergence checks:\n\nIf \\(x_n \\to \\infty\\), prove that for every \\(M &gt; 0\\), eventually \\(x_n &gt; M\\).\nExample: \\(x_n = n\\).\n\nIf \\(x_n\\) oscillates between two or more values that stay apart, it has no limit.\nExample: \\(x_n = (-1)^n\\).\n\n\nThese techniques will reappear often and form the backbone of rigorous \\(\\varepsilon\\)–\\(N\\) proofs.\n\n\n5.4.10 Motivation for the Comparison Theorem\nLila: In all these examples, we always end up bounding \\(|x_n - L|\\) by something simpler that goes to zero.\nLike for \\(\\tfrac{1}{n^2+1}\\), we said it was less than \\(\\tfrac{1}{n^2}\\), and since that goes to zero, the sequence also goes to zero.\nAcharya Bhaskar: Exactly. You’ve spotted a very general pattern.\nIf we can show that the error term \\(|x_n - x|\\) is not bigger than some controlling sequence that shrinks to zero, then \\(x_n\\) must also converge to \\(x\\).\nLila: So instead of always doing the \\(\\varepsilon\\)–\\(N\\) argument from scratch, we can reduce it to something we already know?\nAcharya Bhaskar: Yes. That’s the beauty of it.\nWe use one sequence \\((a_n)\\) that’s already known to converge to \\(0\\), and if \\(|x_n - x|\\) is squeezed under a constant multiple of \\(a_n\\), then \\(x_n\\) must converge to \\(x\\).\nLila: Ah, so this is like a systematic version of the trick we’ve been using.\nAcharya Bhaskar: Precisely. Let me now state this as a theorem.\n\n\n\n5.4.11 Theorem: Controlling a Sequence by Another\nTheorem.\nLet \\((x_n)\\) be a sequence of real numbers and let \\(x \\in \\mathbb{R}\\).\nSuppose \\((a_n)\\) is a sequence of positive real numbers with \\(\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} a_n = 0\\).\nIf there exists a constant \\(C &gt; 0\\) and an \\(m \\in \\mathbb{N}\\) such that\n\\[|x_n - x| \\leq C \\, a_n \\quad \\text{for all } n \\geq m,\\]\nthen\n\\[\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} x_n = x.\\]\n\n\nClick to see the proof\n\nWe want to show that for every \\(\\varepsilon &gt; 0\\), there exists \\(N \\in \\mathbb{N}\\) such that for all \\(n &gt; N\\),\n\\[|x_n - x| &lt; \\varepsilon.\\]\nBy assumption,\n\\[|x_n - x| \\leq C a_n \\quad \\text{for all } n \\geq m.\\]\nSince \\(\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} a_n = 0\\), given \\(\\varepsilon &gt; 0\\) we know there exists \\(N_1 \\in \\mathbb{N}\\) such that for all \\(n &gt; N_1\\),\n\\[a_n &lt; \\frac{\\varepsilon}{C}.\\]\nSo, for \\(n &gt; \\max\\{m, N_1\\}\\), we have\n\\[|x_n - x| \\leq C a_n &lt; C \\cdot \\frac{\\varepsilon}{C} = \\varepsilon.\\]\nTherefore, \\(\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} x_n = x.\\)\n\n\n\n5.4.12 Example: Using the Comparison Theorem\nLila: Can we use this theorem on an example we already know, like \\(\\tfrac{n}{n+1} \\to 1\\)?\nAcharya Bhaskar: Excellent idea. Let’s try.\nWe want to prove\n\\[\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{n}{n+1} = 1.\\]\nFirst compute the error:\n\\[\\Bigg|\\frac{n}{n+1} - 1\\Bigg| = \\frac{1}{n+1}.\\]\nNow notice that\n\\[\\frac{1}{n+1} \\leq \\frac{1}{n} \\quad \\text{for all } n \\geq 1.\\]\nSo we can set \\(a_n = \\tfrac{1}{n}\\), which we already know tends to \\(0\\), and take \\(C = 1\\).\nThen the condition of the theorem is satisfied:\n\\[\\Bigg|\\frac{n}{n+1} - 1\\Bigg| \\leq 1 \\cdot a_n.\\]\nBy the theorem,\n\\[\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{n}{n+1} = 1.\\]\n\nLila: Wow, that was much quicker than the direct \\(\\varepsilon\\)–\\(N\\) proof we did earlier.\nAcharya Bhaskar: Exactly. This theorem saves us effort. Once you have a few standard sequences like \\(\\tfrac{1}{n}\\) or \\(\\tfrac{1}{n^2}\\) whose limits you know, you can use them as benchmarks to prove many others.\n\n\n5.4.13 Example: A Rational Limit with the Comparison Theorem\nLila: Can we also use the theorem for something that looks a bit more complicated, like\n\\[x_n = \\frac{2n+3}{5n+1}?\\]\nAcharya Bhaskar: Certainly. We already proved directly that\n\\[\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{2n+3}{5n+1} = \\frac{2}{5}.\\]\nLet’s see how the comparison theorem helps.\nFirst, compute the error:\n\\[\n\\frac{2n+3}{5n+1} - \\frac{2}{5} = \\frac{13}{25n+5}.\n\\]\nSo,\n\\[\\Bigg|\\frac{2n+3}{5n+1} - \\frac{2}{5}\\Bigg| = \\frac{13}{25n+5}.\\]\nNow notice that for all \\(n \\geq 1\\),\n\\[\\frac{13}{25n+5} \\leq \\frac{13}{25n} = \\frac{13}{25}\\cdot \\frac{1}{n}.\\]\nSo we can set \\(a_n = \\tfrac{1}{n}\\) (which goes to \\(0\\)) and \\(C = \\tfrac{13}{25}\\).\nThen\n\\[|x_n - \\tfrac{2}{5}| \\leq C \\, a_n.\\]\nBy the theorem,\n\\[\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{2n+3}{5n+1} = \\frac{2}{5}.\\]\n\nLila: That really simplifies things! Instead of wrestling with inequalities, we just compare to \\(\\tfrac{1}{n}\\).\nAcharya Bhaskar: Exactly. This method is especially powerful for rational sequences, where the error often turns into a constant times \\(\\tfrac{1}{n}\\).\n\n\n5.4.14 Example: Proving \\(\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} c^{1/n} = 1\\) using Bernoulli’s Inequality\nLila: I remember you said that \\(\\lim c^{1/n} = 1\\) for \\(c &gt; 0\\). Can we prove this?\n\n5.4.14.1 Bernoulli’s Inequality\nAcharya Bhaskar: Before we use it in our proofs, let me remind you of an important inequality.\nBernoulli’s Inequality.\nFor any real number \\(t \\geq -1\\) and any natural number \\(n\\),\n\\[(1+t)^n \\geq 1 + n t.\\]\n\nLila: That looks simple, but why is it true?\nAcharya Bhaskar: Let’s prove it by induction.\n\n\nClick to see the proof\n\nBase case (\\(n=1\\)):\n\\[(1+t)^1 = 1+t = 1+1\\cdot t,\\]\nso the inequality is true.\n\nInductive step:\nAssume \\((1+t)^n \\geq 1 + n t\\) holds for some \\(n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\).\nThen\n\\[(1+t)^{n+1} = (1+t)^n (1+t).\\]\nBy the induction hypothesis,\n\\[(1+t)^{n+1} \\geq (1+nt)(1+t).\\]\nExpanding,\n\\[(1+nt)(1+t) = 1 + (n+1)t + n t^2.\\]\nSince \\(t^2 \\geq 0\\),\n\\[(1+nt)(1+t) \\geq 1 + (n+1)t.\\]\nTherefore,\n\\[(1+t)^{n+1} \\geq 1 + (n+1)t.\\]\nThis completes the induction.\n\nThus, for all \\(t \\geq -1\\) and all \\(n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\),\n\\[(1+t)^n \\geq 1 + n t.\\] ✅\n\nLila: So the inequality is really just saying that the binomial expansion always produces extra positive terms after \\(1 + nt\\).\nAcharya Bhaskar: Exactly. And as we’ll see, it’s very handy in bounding expressions like \\((1+\\varepsilon)^n\\) in convergence proofs. Now, we can prove the main result \\(\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} c^{1/n} = 1\\)\n\n\n\nClick to see the proof\n\nWe want to prove: for every \\(\\varepsilon &gt; 0\\), there exists \\(N\\) such that for \\(n &gt; N\\),\n\\[|c^{1/n} - 1| &lt; \\varepsilon.\\]\n\nCase 1: \\(c &gt; 1\\).\nLet \\(\\varepsilon &gt; 0\\). Consider \\(1+\\varepsilon &gt; 1\\).\nThen\n\\[(1+\\varepsilon)^n \\geq 1 + n\\varepsilon \\quad \\text{(by Bernoulli’s inequality)}.\\]\nSo \\((1+\\varepsilon)^n\\) grows without bound as \\(n \\to \\infty\\).\nTherefore, for sufficiently large \\(n\\), we must have\n\\[(1+\\varepsilon)^n &gt; c.\\]\nThat means\n\\[c^{1/n} &lt; 1 + \\varepsilon.\\]\nOn the other hand, since \\(c &gt; 1\\), clearly \\(c^{1/n} &gt; 1\\) for all \\(n\\).\nSo for large \\(n\\):\n\\[1 &lt; c^{1/n} &lt; 1 + \\varepsilon \\quad \\implies \\quad |c^{1/n} - 1| &lt; \\varepsilon.\\]\n\nCase 2: \\(0 &lt; c &lt; 1\\).\nWrite \\(c = \\tfrac{1}{d}\\) where \\(d &gt; 1\\). Then\n\\[c^{1/n} = \\frac{1}{d^{1/n}}.\\]\nFrom Case 1, \\(d^{1/n} \\to 1\\), so \\(\\tfrac{1}{d^{1/n}} \\to 1\\) as well.\n\nCase 3: \\(c = 1\\).\nTrivial, since \\(c^{1/n} = 1\\) for all \\(n\\).\n\nThus, in all cases \\(c^{1/n} \\to 1\\) as \\(n \\to \\infty\\). ✅\n\nLila: Oh! So Bernoulli’s inequality was the key — it gave us a bound that forced \\(c^{1/n}\\) close to \\(1\\).\nAcharya Bhaskar: Exactly. This is a nice example of how inequalities can give very clean convergence proofs.",
