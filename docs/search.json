    "text": "2.1 🔹 Boundedness\nLila:\n“Acharya, we already have natural numbers, integers, rationals. Why do we need real numbers? Aren’t rationals enough?”\nAcharya Bhaskara:\n“That is a wise question, Lila. Let us test the rationals. Can you think of a number whose square is 2?”\nLila:\n“Well… if I try,\n- \\(1.4^2 = 1.96\\),\n- \\(1.41^2 = 1.9881\\),\n- \\(1.414^2 = 1.999396\\)…\nWe get closer, but never exactly 2.”\nAcharya Bhaskara:\n“So, do you think there is a rational number \\(q\\) with \\(q^2 = 2\\)?”\nLila:\n“No. I’ve seen the proof that \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) is irrational.”\nAcharya Bhaskara:\n“Correct. But notice this: even if \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) is not rational, we can approximate it as closely as we like using rationals — \\(1.4, 1.41, 1.414\\ldots\\) The rationals are dense: between any two rationals there is another. Yet something is still missing.”\nAcharya Bhaskara:\n“Let us capture this rigorously. Consider the set\n\\[\nS = \\{ x \\in \\mathbb{Q} : x^2 &lt; 2 \\}.\n\\]\nIs there a number that is always greater than every element of this set?”\nLila:\n“Sure, 2 is bigger than all of them. So is 1.5, or 1.42.”\nAcharya Bhaskara:\n“Exactly. We call such numbers upper bounds. Here is a precise definition.”\nSimilarly, we can define a lower bound.\nLila:\n“Acharya, you defined what it means for a number to be an upper or lower bound. But what about the set itself? When do we call a set bounded?”\nAcharya Bhaskara:\n“A good question, Lila. Here is the precise definition.”",

Proofs are what give mathematics its certainty. Without proof, we have only belief. With proof, we have knowledge.”\nLila:\n“Can you give me an example?”\nAcharya Bhaskara:\n“Certainly. Take the statement: ‘The square root of 2 is irrational.’ Long ago, many believed that every number was a fraction. But through proof, we know with certainty that \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) cannot be expressed as \\(\\tfrac{p}{q}\\) with integers \\(p\\) and \\(q\\).”\nLila:\n“I see — so proofs are like the backbone that holds mathematics upright.”\nAcharya Bhaskara:\n“Exactly! Proofs force us to use definitions carefully and follow logical steps. They protect us from hidden assumptions. And, more importantly, they reveal why a statement is true, not just that it is true.”\nLila:\n“So every time we state something in real analysis — like that every bounded set has a supremum — we must also prove it?”\nAcharya Bhaskara:\n“Indeed.

The rationals \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) are dense in \\(\\mathbb{R}\\).\nIn contrast, the integers \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) are not dense, because between two consecutive integers, like \\(2\\) and \\(3\\), no integer lies strictly in between.” ## 🔹 Example: Rationals are Dense\nLila:\n“Acharya, can we prove that the rationals are really dense in \\(\\mathbb{R}\\)?”\nAcharya Bhaskara:\n“Of course. This is a fundamental fact: between any two real numbers, there lies a rational.”\n\n\nProof. Proof.\nLet \\(a,b \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) with \\(a &lt; b\\).\nWe need to show there exists a rational \\(q \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\) such that \\(a &lt; q &lt; b\\).\nSince \\(b-a &gt; 0\\), by the Archimedean Property there exists a natural number \\(n\\) such that \\[\n\\frac{1}{n} &lt; b - a.\n\\]\nNow consider the integers \\(k\\) satisfying \\[\nk &gt; a n.\n\\] Let \\(k\\) be the smallest such integer.\nThen \\[\nk-1 \\le a n &lt; k.\n\\] Dividing by \\(n\\) gives \\[\n\\frac{k-1}{n} \\le a &lt; \\frac{k}{n}.\n\\]\nSo \\(\\tfrac{k}{n}\\) is a rational number greater than \\(a\\).\nMoreover, since \\(\\tfrac{1}{n} &lt; b-a\\), we have \\[\n\\frac{k}{n} &lt; a + \\frac{1}{n} &lt; b.\n\\]\nThus \\[\na &lt; \\frac{k}{n} &lt; b,\n\\] and \\(\\frac{k}{n} \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\) lies strictly between \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\nTherefore, \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) is dense in \\(\\mathbb{R}\\).\n\n\nLila:\n“So we used the Archimedean Property to trap a rational in between \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)!”\nAcharya Bhaskara:\n“Exactly.

Divide \\([0,1]\\) into two halves: \\[\n[0,\\tfrac{1}{2}] \\quad \\text{and} \\quad [\\tfrac{1}{2}, 1].\n\\]\nSo the first binary digit \\(a_1\\) tells us whether \\(x\\) lies in the left or right half.\nStep 2: Second division Now, take the half chosen in Step 1 and bisect it again.\nDepending on which subinterval contains \\(x\\), we assign \\(a_2=0\\) (left) or \\(a_2=1\\) (right).\nLila: So \\(a_2\\) refines the position of \\(x\\) within the chosen half?\nAcharya Bhaskar: Exactly. Continuing this process, at the \\(n\\)-th step we decide whether \\(x\\) lies in the left or right subinterval, and record the digit \\(a_n\\).\nStep 3: Infinite process Thus we build a sequence of digits \\(a_1,a_2,a_3,\\dots\\) where each \\(a_i \\in \\{0,1\\}\\). These digits define the binary expansion: \\[\nx = 0.a_1a_2a_3\\ldots \\quad \\text{(in base 2)}.\n\\]\nFormally, \\[\nx = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{a_n}{2^n}.\n\\]\nLila: Ah, so each digit corresponds to a left-or-right choice in successive subdivisions of \\([0,1]\\). That’s just like building a nested sequence of intervals!\nAcharya Bhaskar: Well observed. In fact, the intersection of these nested intervals is exactly the single point \\(x\\). The binary expansion records the entire path of choices.",

    "text": "4.3 Decimal Representation via [0,1]\nLila: Acharya, now that I understand binary representation, what about decimal representation of real numbers? How do we obtain that?\nAcharya Bhaskar: Very good question, Lila. The idea is very similar to binary, except instead of dividing into two parts, we divide the interval \\([0,1]\\) into ten equal parts.\n\nFirst digit\nAcharya Bhaskar: Let \\(x \\in [0,1]\\). We divide \\([0,1]\\) into ten subintervals: \\[\n\\Big[0,\\tfrac{1}{10}\\Big], \\Big[\\tfrac{1}{10},\\tfrac{2}{10}\\Big], \\dots, \\Big[\\tfrac{9}{10},1\\Big].\n\\]\n\nIf \\(x\\) lies in the first interval, set \\(d_1=0\\).\n\nIf \\(x\\) lies in the second interval, set \\(d_1=1\\).\n\nAnd so on, up to \\(d_1=9\\) if \\(x \\in [\\tfrac{9}{10},1]\\).\n\nThis \\(d_1\\) is the first decimal digit after the point.\nLila: So \\(d_1\\) tells us in which tenth of the interval \\([0,1]\\) the number \\(x\\) lies.\n\nSecond digit\nAcharya Bhaskar: Exactly. Now, take the subinterval chosen in Step 1 and divide it again into ten equal parts.\nThe position of \\(x\\) in this subdivision gives us \\(d_2\\), the second decimal digit.\nLila: Just like in binary, but with ten instead of two!\n\nInfinite process\nAcharya Bhaskar: Yes. Continuing this process, we construct digits \\(d_1,d_2,d_3,\\dots\\) with \\(d_i \\in \\{0,1,2,\\dots,9\\}\\).\nThese digits define the decimal expansion: \\[\nx = 0.d_1d_2d_3\\ldots \\quad \\text{(in base 10)}.\n\\]\nFormally, \\[\nx = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{d_n}{10^n}.\n\\]\n\n\n4.3.1 Example: Find the decimal repersentation of \\(x = \\tfrac{2}{7}\\)\n\nFirst step: \\(2/7\\) lies in the third subinterval \\([2/10,3/10]\\), so \\(d_1=2\\).\n\nSecond step: within \\([2/10,3/10]\\), divide into tenths: \\([28/100,29/100]\\) contains \\(2/7\\), so \\(d_2=8\\).\n\nThird step: now inside \\([28/100,29/100]\\), we find \\(2/7\\) in \\([285/1000,286/1000]\\), so \\(d_3=5\\).\n\nFourth step: inside \\([285/1000,286/1000]\\), we find \\(2/7\\) in \\([2857/10000,2858/10000]\\), so \\(d_4=7\\).\n\nContinuing this way, we uncover the repeating decimal expansion: \\[\n\\frac{2}{7} = 0.285714285714\\ldots\n\\]\nLila: That’s neat! The digits appear directly from locating \\(x\\) in finer and finer tenths.\n\n\n\n4.3.2 A subtlety: non-uniqueness\nLila: Are decimal representations always unique?\nAcharya Bhaskar: A very sharp question, Lila. In fact, they are not always unique. For example, \\[\n0.5000\\ldots = 0.4999\\ldots\n\\] represent the same number.\nLila: Oh, I see. So sometimes a terminating decimal has an alternative representation with repeating \\(9\\)s.\nAcharya Bhaskar: Exactly. This happens whenever the decimal expansion ends. You may think of it as the final subinterval having two possible “addresses” — one ending in an infinite string of zeros, and the other in an infinite string of nines.\nLila: So aside from this special case, decimal representations are unique?\nAcharya Bhaskar: Yes, apart from this subtlety, each real number in \\([0,1]\\) corresponds to exactly one infinite decimal expansion.\n\nLila: That clears it up! Decimal representation is really just like binary, except we use partitions into ten instead of two, with a small quirk about repeating \\(9\\)s.\nAcharya Bhaskar: Exactly, Lila. And this connection between interval subdivisions and digit expansions is a powerful idea in real analysis.",

    "text": "5.4 Why study sequences and series?\nLila: Why are these so important?\nAcharya Bhaskar: Because they are the language of approximation and analysis: 1. Important numbers like \\(e\\) and \\(\\pi\\) appear as limits of sequences or sums of series.\n2. Functions like \\(\\sin x\\), \\(\\cos x\\), and \\(e^x\\) can be expressed as infinite series — that’s how we calculate them on computers!\n3. Understanding limits of sequences helps us define continuity, derivatives, and integrals.\nLila: So sequences and series are the foundation stones for the rest of calculus and analysis.\nAcharya Bhaskar: Precisely. Real analysis begins here, with the careful study of how infinite processes behave.\n\nAcharya Bhaskar (teaser):\n“Think of a sequence as footsteps marching towards a destination.\nIf the footsteps wander endlessly, the sequence diverges.\nIf they march steadily towards a point, the sequence converges.\nAnd when you add the footsteps together, you create the story of a series.”\n## Limits of Sequences\nLila: Acharya, you said some sequences “converge” and some “diverge.” What exactly does it mean for a sequence to converge?\nAcharya Bhaskar: Good question, Lila. Intuitively, a sequence converges if its terms get closer and closer to some fixed number, which we call the limit.\nLila: So for \\(a_n = \\tfrac{1}{n}\\), the terms \\(1, \\tfrac{1}{2}, \\tfrac{1}{3}, \\dots\\) get closer and closer to \\(0\\), so the limit should be \\(0\\)?\nAcharya Bhaskar: Exactly. We write \\[\n\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\frac{1}{n} = 0.\n\\]\n\n\n5.4.1 The formal definition\nAcharya Bhaskar: But in real analysis we need precision. So here is the definition:\nA sequence \\((a_n)\\) is said to converge to a number \\(L\\) if for every \\(\\varepsilon &gt; 0\\), there exists a natural number \\(K(\\varepsilon)\\) such that whenever \\(n \\geq K(\\varepsilon)\\), we have \\[\n|a_n - L| &lt; \\varepsilon.\n\\]\nLila: Let me see if I understand. This means: no matter how small an error margin \\(\\varepsilon\\) I choose, if I go far enough in the sequence (beyond some \\(K\\) that depends on the given \\(\\varepsilon\\)), all terms stay within that margin around \\(L\\).\nAcharya Bhaskar: Well said. That is the precise meaning of convergence.\n\nExample: \\(a_n = \\tfrac{1}{n}\\)\nLila: Could we test this definition with \\(a_n = \\tfrac{1}{n}\\) and \\(L=0\\)?\nAcharya Bhaskar: Certainly.\nWe want: for every \\(\\varepsilon&gt;0\\), find \\(K(\\varepsilon)\\) such that if \\(n\\ge K(\\varepsilon)\\), then \\(|\\tfrac{1}{n} - 0| &lt; \\varepsilon\\).\nBut \\(|\\tfrac{1}{n} - 0| = \\tfrac{1}{n}\\).\nSo we require \\(\\tfrac{1}{n} &lt; \\varepsilon\\).\nThis is the same as \\(n &gt; \\tfrac{1}{\\varepsilon}\\).\nSo if we choose \\(K(\\varepsilon) = \\lceil \\tfrac{1}{\\varepsilon}\\rceil\\), then for all \\(n\\ge K(\\varepsilon)\\), the condition is satisfied.\nLila: That works! So the formal definition confirms that \\(\\tfrac{1}{n} \\to 0\\).\n\nExample: \\(a_n = (-1)^n\\)\nLila: And what about \\(a_n = (-1)^n\\)?\nAcharya Bhaskar: Then the terms alternate \\(-1, 1, -1, 1, \\dots\\). Do they get closer to a single value?\nLila: No — they keep jumping back and forth. So this sequence does not converge.\nAcharya Bhaskar: Correct. It diverges, because there is no single \\(L\\) that the terms approach.\n\n\n\n5.4.2 Why limits matter\nLila: So convergence is about sequences approaching a fixed target. But why is this so important?\nAcharya Bhaskar: Because the notion of limit is the cornerstone of analysis. Continuity, derivatives, integrals, and infinite series all depend on it. Mastering limits of sequences is the first step toward the deeper structures of calculus.\nLimit of a function via sequences\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteConnecting sequence limits and function limits\n\n\n\n\n\nLila: Acharya, I understand the limit of a sequence. But what could the limit of sequences have to do with the notion of limits of functions?\nAcharya Bhaskar: An excellent question, Lila. In fact, the two ideas are deeply connected.\nWe say \\[\n\\lim_{x\\to a} f(x) = L\n\\] if and only if for every sequence \\((x_n)\\) with \\(x_n \\to a\\) and \\(x_n \\neq a\\), the sequence \\((f(x_n))\\) converges to \\(L\\).\n\nLila: So if all possible sequences approaching \\(a\\) give the same limiting value \\(L\\) for \\(f(x_n)\\), then that must be the limit of the function?\nAcharya Bhaskar: Exactly. This is called the sequential criterion for functional limits.\nIt tells us: instead of thinking about all the infinitely many “ways” of approaching \\(a\\), it is enough to test every possible sequence converging to \\(a\\).\n\nLila: Ah! So the concept of a function limit is really an extension of the idea of sequence limits.\nAcharya Bhaskar: Precisely, Lila. That is why we first built a strong foundation with sequences — they are the key to understanding limits of functions.",
