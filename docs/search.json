Aren’t rationals enough?”\nAcharya Bhaskara:\n“That is a wise question, Lila. Let us test the rationals. Can you think of a number whose square is 2?”\nLila:\n“Well… if I try,\n- \\(1.4^2 = 1.96\\),\n- \\(1.41^2 = 1.9881\\),\n- \\(1.414^2 = 1.999396\\)…\nWe get closer, but never exactly 2.”\nAcharya Bhaskara:\n“So, do you think there is a rational number \\(q\\) with \\(q^2 = 2\\)?”\nLila:\n“No. I’ve seen the proof that \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) is irrational.”\nAcharya Bhaskara:\n“Correct. But notice this: even if \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) is not rational, we can approximate it as closely as we like using rationals — \\(1.4, 1.41, 1.414\\ldots\\) The rationals are dense: between any two rationals there is another. Yet something is still missing.”",

If something feels obviously true, can’t we just accept it?”\nAcharya Bhaskara:\n“Ah, that is the difference between intuition and mathematics. Intuition is helpful, but it can also mislead us. Proofs are what give mathematics its certainty. Without proof, we have only belief. With proof, we have knowledge.”\nLila:\n“Can you give me an example?”\nAcharya Bhaskara:\n“Certainly. Take the statement: ‘The square root of 2 is irrational.’ Long ago, many believed that every number was a fraction. But through proof, we know with certainty that \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) cannot be expressed as \\(\\tfrac{p}{q}\\) with integers \\(p\\) and \\(q\\).”\nLila:\n“I see — so proofs are like the backbone that holds mathematics upright.”\nAcharya Bhaskara:\n“Exactly! Proofs force us to use definitions carefully and follow logical steps. They protect us from hidden assumptions. And, more importantly, they reveal why a statement is true, not just that it is true.”\nLila:\n“So every time we state something in real analysis — like that every bounded set has a supremum — we must also prove it?”\nAcharya Bhaskara:\n“Indeed. That completeness axiom we discussed is itself an assumption. But once accepted, we must prove all consequences from it rigorously. That is the art of analysis: building a tower of truth, brick by brick, proof by proof.”",

Once you master this structure, many proofs in analysis will follow the same pattern.”\nLila:\n“So even though neither \\(0\\) nor \\(1\\) are in the set \\((0,1)\\), they still serve as its infimum and supremum?”\nAcharya Bhaskara:\n“Exactly!
