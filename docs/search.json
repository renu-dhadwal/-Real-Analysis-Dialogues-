Aren’t rationals enough?”\nAcharya Bhaskara:\n“That is a wise question, Lila. Let us test the rationals. Can you think of a number whose square is 2?”\nLila:\n“Well… if I try,\n- \\(1.4^2 = 1.96\\),\n- \\(1.41^2 = 1.9881\\),\n- \\(1.414^2 = 1.999396\\)…\nWe get closer, but never exactly 2.”\nAcharya Bhaskara:\n“So, do you think there is a rational number \\(q\\) with \\(q^2 = 2\\)?”\nLila:\n“No. I’ve seen the proof that \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) is irrational.”\nAcharya Bhaskara:\n“Correct. But notice this: even if \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) is not rational, we can approximate it as closely as we like using rationals — \\(1.4, 1.41, 1.414\\ldots\\) The rationals are dense: between any two rationals there is another.

If something feels obviously true, can’t we just accept it?”\nAcharya Bhaskara:\n“Ah, that is the difference between intuition and mathematics. Intuition is helpful, but it can also mislead us. Proofs are what give mathematics its certainty. Without proof, we have only belief. With proof, we have knowledge.”\nLila:\n“Can you give me an example?”\nAcharya Bhaskara:\n“Certainly. Take the statement: ‘The square root of 2 is irrational.’ Long ago, many believed that every number was a fraction. But through proof, we know with certainty that \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) cannot be expressed as \\(\\tfrac{p}{q}\\) with integers \\(p\\) and \\(q\\).”\nLila:\n“I see — so proofs are like the backbone that holds mathematics upright.”\nAcharya Bhaskara:\n“Exactly! Proofs force us to use definitions carefully and follow logical steps. They protect us from hidden assumptions. And, more importantly, they reveal why a statement is true, not just that it is true.”\nLila:\n“So every time we state something in real analysis — like that every bounded set has a supremum — we must also prove it?”\nAcharya Bhaskara:\n“Indeed. That completeness axiom we discussed is itself an assumption. But once accepted, we must prove all consequences from it rigorously.

The rationals \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) are dense in \\(\\mathbb{R}\\).\nIn contrast, the integers \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) are not dense, because between two consecutive integers, like \\(2\\) and \\(3\\), no integer lies strictly in between.” ## 🔹 Example: Rationals are Dense\nLila:\n“Acharya, can we prove that the rationals are really dense in \\(\\mathbb{R}\\)?”\nAcharya Bhaskara:\n“Of course. This is a fundamental fact: between any two real numbers, there lies a rational.”\n\n\nProof. Proof.\nLet \\(a,b \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) with \\(a &lt; b\\).\nWe need to show there exists a rational \\(q \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\) such that \\(a &lt; q &lt; b\\).\nSince \\(b-a &gt; 0\\), by the Archimedean Property there exists a natural number \\(n\\) such that \\[\n\\frac{1}{n} &lt; b - a.\n\\]\nNow consider the integers \\(k\\) satisfying \\[\nk &gt; a n.\n\\] Let \\(k\\) be the smallest such integer.\nThen \\[\nk-1 \\le a n &lt; k.\n\\] Dividing by \\(n\\) gives \\[\n\\frac{k-1}{n} \\le a &lt; \\frac{k}{n}.\n\\]\nSo \\(\\tfrac{k}{n}\\) is a rational number greater than \\(a\\).\nMoreover, since \\(\\tfrac{1}{n} &lt; b-a\\), we have \\[\n\\frac{k}{n} &lt; a + \\frac{1}{n} &lt; b.\n\\]\nThus \\[\na &lt; \\frac{k}{n} &lt; b,\n\\] and \\(\\frac{k}{n} \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\) lies strictly between \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\nTherefore, \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) is dense in \\(\\mathbb{R}\\).\n\n\nLila:\n“So we used the Archimedean Property to trap a rational in between \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)!”\nAcharya Bhaskara:\n“Exactly.
