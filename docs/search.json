    "text": "3 🌊 Level 1: Completeness of the Real Numbers\nLila:\n“Acharya, we already have natural numbers, integers, rationals. Why do we need real numbers? Aren’t rationals enough?”\nAcharya Bhaskara:\n“That is a wise question, Lila. Let us test the rationals. Can you think of a number whose square is 2?”\nLila:\n“Well… if I try,\n- \\(1.4^2 = 1.96\\),\n- \\(1.41^2 = 1.9881\\),\n- \\(1.414^2 = 1.999396\\)…\nWe get closer, but never exactly 2.”\nAcharya Bhaskara:\n“So, do you think there is a rational number \\(q\\) with \\(q^2 = 2\\)?”\nLila:\n“No. I’ve seen the proof that \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) is irrational.”\nAcharya Bhaskara:\n“Correct. But notice this: even if \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) is not rational, we can approximate it as closely as we like using rationals — \\[1.4, 1.41, 1.414\\ldots\\] The rationals are dense: between any two rationals there is another. Yet something is still missing.”",

So is 1.5, or 1.42.”\nAcharya Bhaskara:\nExactly. We call such numbers upper bounds.

But what about the set itself? When do we call a set bounded?”\nAcharya Bhaskara:\n“A good question, Lila. Here is the precise definition.”\n\nDefinition (Bounded Set).\nA set \\(S \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}\\) is said to be bounded above if it has an upper bound.\nIt is bounded below if it has a lower bound.\nIf \\(S\\) is both bounded above and below, then \\(S\\) is called a bounded set.\nFormally, there exist real numbers \\(m, M \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) such that \\[\nm \\le x \\le M \\quad \\text{for all } x \\in S.\n\\]",

    "text": "3.2 🔹 Examples\n\nExample 1.\nThe interval [0,1] is bounded above by 1, 2, \\(\\ldots\\) and bounded below by 0, -1, \\(\\ldots\\).\nIn fact, 0 and 1 are the tightest bounds, so the set is bounded.\n\n\nExample 2.\nThe set \\(\\mathbb{N} = \\{1,2,3,\\ldots\\}\\) is bounded below (by \\(1, 0, -5, \\ldots\\)),\nbut it is not bounded above — it grows without end.\n\n\nExample 3.\nThe set \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) of all integers has no upper bound and no lower bound.\nThus, it is not bounded.\n\nLila:\n“So a set is bounded if it fits within some finite interval \\([m,M]\\) on the number line?”\nAcharya Bhaskara:\n“Exactly! That’s the intuition — bounded sets live inside some finite cage on the real line.\nUnbounded sets escape that cage, either upward, downward, or both.”\nAcharya Bhaskara:\n“But among upper bounds some are tighter than others. Which number feels like the ‘tightest’ upper bound for our set $ S = { x : x^2 &lt; 2 }. $?”\nLila:\n“It should be \\(\\sqrt{2}\\), since that’s where the set stops.”\nAcharya Bhaskara:\n“Indeed. But here is the problem: \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) is not in \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\). So the rationals cannot capture the least upper bound of this set.”\n\n\n3.2.1 🔹 Supremum\nAcharya Bhaskara:\n“This brings us to another definition:\n\nDefinition (Upper Bound).\nLet \\(A \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}\\).\nA number \\(M \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) is called an upper bound of \\(A\\) if \\[\nx \\le M \\quad \\text{for all } x \\in A.\n\\]\n\n\nDefinition (Least Upper Bound / Supremum).\nThe least upper bound (or supremum) of a set \\(A \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}\\) is the smallest number \\(M\\) such that \\(M\\) is an upper bound of \\(A\\).\nFormally, \\(M = \\sup A\\) if 1. \\(x \\le M\\) for all \\(x \\in A\\), and\n2. for any \\(\\varepsilon &gt; 0\\), there exists \\(x \\in A\\) such that \\(x &gt; M - \\varepsilon\\).\n\n“So the problem with rationals is that some sets don’t have a supremum inside them?”\nAcharya Bhaskara:\n“Precisely. The rationals are dense but not complete. The missing piece is the completeness property of the real numbers.”",
