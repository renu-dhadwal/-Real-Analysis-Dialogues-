    "text": "2.1 🔹 Boundedness\nLila:\n“Acharya, we already have natural numbers, integers, rationals. Why do we need real numbers? Aren’t rationals enough?”\nAcharya Bhaskara:\n“That is a wise question, Lila. Let us test the rationals. Can you think of a number whose square is 2?”\nLila:\n“Well… if I try,\n- \\(1.4^2 = 1.96\\),\n- \\(1.41^2 = 1.9881\\),\n- \\(1.414^2 = 1.999396\\)…\nWe get closer, but never exactly 2.”\nAcharya Bhaskara:\n“So, do you think there is a rational number \\(q\\) with \\(q^2 = 2\\)?”\nLila:\n“No. I’ve seen the proof that \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) is irrational.”\nAcharya Bhaskara:\n“Correct. But notice this: even if \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) is not rational, we can approximate it as closely as we like using rationals — \\(1.4, 1.41, 1.414\\ldots\\) The rationals are dense: between any two rationals there is another. Yet something is still missing.”\nAcharya Bhaskara:\n“Let us capture this rigorously. Consider the set\n\\[\nS = \\{ x \\in \\mathbb{Q} : x^2 &lt; 2 \\}.\n\\]\nIs there a number that is always greater than every element of this set?”\nLila:\n“Sure, 2 is bigger than all of them. So is 1.5, or 1.42.”\nAcharya Bhaskara:\n“Exactly. We call such numbers upper bounds. Here is a precise definition.”\nSimilarly, we can define a lower bound.\nLila:\n“Acharya, you defined what it means for a number to be an upper or lower bound. But what about the set itself? When do we call a set bounded?”\nAcharya Bhaskara:\n“A good question, Lila. Here is the precise definition.”",

Proofs are what give mathematics its certainty. Without proof, we have only belief. With proof, we have knowledge.”\nLila:\n“Can you give me an example?”\nAcharya Bhaskara:\n“Certainly. Take the statement: ‘The square root of 2 is irrational.’ Long ago, many believed that every number was a fraction. But through proof, we know with certainty that \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) cannot be expressed as \\(\\tfrac{p}{q}\\) with integers \\(p\\) and \\(q\\).”\nLila:\n“I see — so proofs are like the backbone that holds mathematics upright.”\nAcharya Bhaskara:\n“Exactly! Proofs force us to use definitions carefully and follow logical steps. They protect us from hidden assumptions. And, more importantly, they reveal why a statement is true, not just that it is true.”\nLila:\n“So every time we state something in real analysis — like that every bounded set has a supremum — we must also prove it?”\nAcharya Bhaskara:\n“Indeed.

The rationals \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) are dense in \\(\\mathbb{R}\\).\nIn contrast, the integers \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) are not dense, because between two consecutive integers, like \\(2\\) and \\(3\\), no integer lies strictly in between.” ## 🔹 Example: Rationals are Dense\nLila:\n“Acharya, can we prove that the rationals are really dense in \\(\\mathbb{R}\\)?”\nAcharya Bhaskara:\n“Of course. This is a fundamental fact: between any two real numbers, there lies a rational.”\n\n\nProof. Proof.\nLet \\(a,b \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) with \\(a &lt; b\\).\nWe need to show there exists a rational \\(q \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\) such that \\(a &lt; q &lt; b\\).\nSince \\(b-a &gt; 0\\), by the Archimedean Property there exists a natural number \\(n\\) such that \\[\n\\frac{1}{n} &lt; b - a.\n\\]\nNow consider the integers \\(k\\) satisfying \\[\nk &gt; a n.\n\\] Let \\(k\\) be the smallest such integer.\nThen \\[\nk-1 \\le a n &lt; k.\n\\] Dividing by \\(n\\) gives \\[\n\\frac{k-1}{n} \\le a &lt; \\frac{k}{n}.\n\\]\nSo \\(\\tfrac{k}{n}\\) is a rational number greater than \\(a\\).\nMoreover, since \\(\\tfrac{1}{n} &lt; b-a\\), we have \\[\n\\frac{k}{n} &lt; a + \\frac{1}{n} &lt; b.\n\\]\nThus \\[\na &lt; \\frac{k}{n} &lt; b,\n\\] and \\(\\frac{k}{n} \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\) lies strictly between \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\nTherefore, \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) is dense in \\(\\mathbb{R}\\).\n\n\nLila:\n“So we used the Archimedean Property to trap a rational in between \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)!”\nAcharya Bhaskara:\n“Exactly.

But I’m curious—how can real numbers be expressed in binary? And does this have any connection with the Nested Interval Property?\nAcharya Bhaskar: Excellent thought, Lila. Indeed, binary representation arises quite naturally if we repeatedly bisect the interval \\([0,1]\\). Let’s explore how this works.\nStep 1: First division Take any real number \\(x \\in [0,1]\\). Divide \\([0,1]\\) into two halves: \\[\n[0,\\tfrac{1}{2}] \\quad \\text{and} \\quad [\\tfrac{1}{2}, 1].\n\\]\nSo the first binary digit \\(a_1\\) tells us whether \\(x\\) lies in the left or right half.\nStep 2: Second division Now, take the half chosen in Step 1 and bisect it again.\nDepending on which subinterval contains \\(x\\), we assign \\(a_2=0\\) (left) or \\(a_2=1\\) (right).\nLila: So \\(a_2\\) refines the position of \\(x\\) within the chosen half?\nAcharya Bhaskar: Exactly. Continuing this process, at the \\(n\\)-th step we decide whether \\(x\\) lies in the left or right subinterval, and record the digit \\(a_n\\).\nStep 3: Infinite process Thus we build a sequence of digits \\(a_1,a_2,a_3,\\dots\\) where each \\(a_i \\in \\{0,1\\}\\). These digits define the binary expansion: \\[\nx = 0.a_1a_2a_3\\ldots \\quad \\text{(in base 2)}.\n\\]\nFormally, \\[\nx = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{a_n}{2^n}.\n\\]\nLila: Ah, so each digit corresponds to a left-or-right choice in successive subdivisions of \\([0,1]\\). That’s just like building a nested sequence of intervals!\nAcharya Bhaskar: Well observed. In fact, the intersection of these nested intervals is exactly the single point \\(x\\). The binary expansion records the entire path of choices.",

    "text": "4.3 Decimal Representation via [0,1]\nLila: Acharya, now that I understand binary representation, what about decimal representation of real numbers? How do we obtain that?\nAcharya Bhaskar: Very good question, Lila. The idea is very similar to binary, except instead of dividing into two parts, we divide the interval \\([0,1]\\) into ten equal parts.\n\nFirst digit\nAcharya Bhaskar: Let \\(x \\in [0,1]\\). We divide \\([0,1]\\) into ten subintervals: \\[\n\\Big[0,\\tfrac{1}{10}\\Big], \\Big[\\tfrac{1}{10},\\tfrac{2}{10}\\Big], \\dots, \\Big[\\tfrac{9}{10},1\\Big].\n\\]\n\nIf \\(x\\) lies in the first interval, set \\(d_1=0\\).\n\nIf \\(x\\) lies in the second interval, set \\(d_1=1\\).\n\nAnd so on, up to \\(d_1=9\\) if \\(x \\in [\\tfrac{9}{10},1]\\).\n\nThis \\(d_1\\) is the first decimal digit after the point.\nLila: So \\(d_1\\) tells us in which tenth of the interval \\([0,1]\\) the number \\(x\\) lies.\n\nSecond digit\nAcharya Bhaskar: Exactly. Now, take the subinterval chosen in Step 1 and divide it again into ten equal parts.\nThe position of \\(x\\) in this subdivision gives us \\(d_2\\), the second decimal digit.\nLila: Just like in binary, but with ten instead of two!\n\nInfinite process\nAcharya Bhaskar: Yes. Continuing this process, we construct digits \\(d_1,d_2,d_3,\\dots\\) with \\(d_i \\in \\{0,1,2,\\dots,9\\}\\).\nThese digits define the decimal expansion: \\[\nx = 0.d_1d_2d_3\\ldots \\quad \\text{(in base 10)}.\n\\]\nFormally, \\[\nx = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{d_n}{10^n}.\n\\]\n\n\n4.3.1 Example: Find the decimal repersentation of \\(x = \\tfrac{2}{7}\\)\n\nFirst step: \\(2/7\\) lies in the third subinterval \\([2/10,3/10]\\), so \\(d_1=2\\).\n\nSecond step: within \\([2/10,3/10]\\), divide into tenths: \\([28/100,29/100]\\) contains \\(2/7\\), so \\(d_2=8\\).\n\nThird step: now inside \\([28/100,29/100]\\), we find \\(2/7\\) in \\([285/1000,286/1000]\\), so \\(d_3=5\\).\n\nFourth step: inside \\([285/1000,286/1000]\\), we find \\(2/7\\) in \\([2857/10000,2858/10000]\\), so \\(d_4=7\\).\n\nContinuing this way, we uncover the repeating decimal expansion: \\[\n\\frac{2}{7} = 0.285714285714\\ldots\n\\]\nLila: That’s neat! The digits appear directly from locating \\(x\\) in finer and finer tenths.\n\n\n\n4.3.2 A subtlety: non-uniqueness\nLila: Are decimal representations always unique?\nAcharya Bhaskar: A very sharp question, Lila. In fact, they are not always unique. For example, \\[\n0.5000\\ldots = 0.4999\\ldots\n\\] represent the same number.\nLila: Oh, I see. So sometimes a terminating decimal has an alternative representation with repeating \\(9\\)s.\nAcharya Bhaskar: Exactly. This happens whenever the decimal expansion ends. You may think of it as the final subinterval having two possible “addresses” — one ending in an infinite string of zeros, and the other in an infinite string of nines.\nLila: So aside from this special case, decimal representations are unique?\nAcharya Bhaskar: Yes, apart from this subtlety, each real number in \\([0,1]\\) corresponds to exactly one infinite decimal expansion.\n\nLila: That clears it up! Decimal representation is really just like binary, except we use partitions into ten instead of two, with a small quirk about repeating \\(9\\)s.\nAcharya Bhaskar: Exactly, Lila. And this connection between interval subdivisions and digit expansions is a powerful idea in real analysis.",
